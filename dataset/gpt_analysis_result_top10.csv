The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,55371,l97ykd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/,8027,1612109430.0,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation I have been following GME since mid September and over that time I have banked myself a 1300 return in the process However the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been especially this week The company had more than 100 of its stock sold short That's never happened before you say I know I know but that's not actually not a new thing A short squeeze even one of this magnitude should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks Something is just not right I think there is something much much bigger going on here Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system Here is my hypothesis I think the hedge funds clearing houses and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME possibly 100 200 or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop In the process they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now What is that bomb I believe retail investors may hold more than 100 of GME not just 100 of the float more than 100 of the actual company This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system For you to follow this argument you need to go read the white paper Counterfeiting Stock 2 0 so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares They use these fake shares in short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short There is even a term for it strategic fails–to–deliver Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal similar level to counterfeiting money but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME It's not just about a short squeeze it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100 of shares in existence There are are 71 million shares of GME that have ever been issued by the company Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than 102 000 000 shares including the 13 of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen Now I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100 of GME is owned by these firms if not more Moreover there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50 Some of us are even holding thousands If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5 10 we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber that puts the minimum retail position at about 30 50 of the entire company GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month We don't have January data yet but I just analyzed the data from the SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December all 65 871 lines of it and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit For comparison I did the same for a couple random tickers Most companies have close to no shares not show up Of those that do it's a relatively small number of shares For example two random companies Lowes $LOW $125B market cap had 13 960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month Boston Beer Company $SAM $11 5B market cap had 295 shares fail to be delivered How many shares of GME failed to deliver 1 787 191 As the white papers points out the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January I'm willing to bet its many times that Look at how that compares to other companies' stock Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December x axis vs the number of companies that fall into that bin y axis GME is an extreme outlier I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC the clearing houses and the hedge funds are all in on it That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares No real shares can be found and it's about to cause the system to fall apart TLDR We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result Disclaimer I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance I have no inside knowledge of how the financial system works and I may be wrong on some of this This is not financial advice and you shouldn't trade based on it I am book smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you Obligatory rocket 🚀 x200B EDIT 0 Looks like I truly belong on this sub On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution My numbers were wrong but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers EDIT 1 You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers not the entire NYSE I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though EDIT 2 Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares report Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME EDIT 3 A lot of people were hung up on the 3 shares per wsb subscriber thing I know many accounts are bots I was intentionally underestimating that number I have adjusted to 10 shares per legit subscriber to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns EDIT 4 What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system We're not going to go back to mud huts people This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems possibly bankrupting some of them Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again EDIT 5 Backup link for white paper EDIT 6 I am getting thousands of messages I won't be able to respond to all of them Here is an FAQ 1 How do I learn investing I am not an authority on this but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks Read the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham for this Then learn how to think about picking stocks I like Peter Lynch's books for this 2 What is going to happen this week I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess 3 Are you going to be killed I don't know where people are getting this idea I have no special knowledge or insider contacts and I am in no way shape or form an expert on the market or the system behind it Please treat my tinfoil hat conspiracy theories as just that There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to take down the shorts or anything like that I do not advocate for you to buy hold or sell I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place ,2021-01-31

GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,57106,le235t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/,5051,1612660942.0,GME Institutions Hold 177 of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze DISCLAIMER This post is NOT Financial Advice This is actual DD of just statistical cold hard facts My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings Institutions currently hold 177 of the float How is this even possible to own more than 100 of the float Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million In a shorting transaction institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A then sells them to Institution C If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares 20 5 —or 125 25 ÷ 20 In this case institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100 In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100 actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high While somewhat imprecise arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling 1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves data from 9/30/20 but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying are we really going to just let this happen What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately especially when order flows go directly through Citadel But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts This is options expiring 3/12/21 and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest those who write options aka theta gang for price to gravitate towards max pain as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses And right now we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above Thank you for taking your time to read my DD my original post on wsb was removed by the mods MODS please don't delete This is actual DD of just statistical cold hard facts My previous post got deleted if this one does too spread the word Edit This post was removed then reinstated and I am now banned unable to comment and post to this subreddit Edit 2 hi u/OPINION IS UNPOPULAR I would comment and post but I am literally unable to on this subreddit Edit 3 I'm unbanned ,2021-02-07 03:22:22,GME:NULL,0,,,,,,,,,

I feel like clarification is needed about Today,69137,laikd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laikd0/i_feel_like_clarification_is_needed_about_today/,4695,1612253867.0,I feel like clarification is needed about Today There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions Why no spike today First of all we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER They use several tactics to delay it but they can’t circumvent it They’re bleeding and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies It might take just a few days or weeks But eventually when they cover WE retail investors get to set the price That’s why you keep seeing 10k or 69420$ is not a meme Because it’s not We also know they’re down BAD Why Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so So let’s see what tactics they are using Short ladder attacks What is a short ladder attack The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves There is little to no volume on those trades and since no one can buy it looks like the stock is plummeting It’s only effective if we would sell Just look at the volume People are not selling Infiltrating WSB and other social media Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD Obvious shills There’s tons of them Always new or old accounts that suddenly post again All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell Manipulating the Media Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market SEC if you read this Now let’s get some clarification on SILVER There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver People don’t seem to realize 3 things 1 Silver is not a get rich quick move Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move GME is a risky short term play So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today YOLO 2 The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make 3 The hedge funds would love for you to go all in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media SLV inverting GME The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins IF you want to go into silver for whatever reason buy physical But that’s just my retard opinion SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“ You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not and never was about starting crazy short squeezes GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME Silver squeeze not happening links Well Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly Short Version The short version is that a review of the 'strategic fails–to–deliver' data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday There are are 71 million shares of GME that have ever been issued by the company Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than 102 000 000 shares including the 13 of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen That is already 30 000 000 shares more than even exist On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions retail investors may currently hold 50 million shares counting both long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM Once you include call options retail investors may already hold more than 100 of GME not just 100 of the float more than 100 of the actual company This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system Long version here At these levels it’s NOT about the price it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession That’s why they want you to sell so bad

Moon or zero 🦍🦍🦍 APES STRONG TOGETHER 🦍🦍🦍 Disclaimer This is not financial advice I’m literally an ape I just like the stock Do your own DD and avoid the fake new and/or resurrected accounts here and

Open Letter to Melvin Capital CNBC Boomers and WSB Mods do not delete this is important to me please read x200B I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life and the lives of those close to me I was fortunate my parents were prudent and a little paranoid and they had some food storage saved up When that crisis hit our family we were able to keep our little house but we lived off of pancake mix and powdered milk and beans and rice for a year Ever since then my parents have kept a food storage and they keep it updated and fresh Those close to me my friends and extended family were not nearly as fortunate My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like My friends got to find out Almost a year after the crisis' low my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work One of them built a new closet in our guest room Another one did some landscaping in our backyard I will forever be so proud of my parents because in a time of need even when I have no doubt money was still tight they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it To Melvin Capital you stand for everything that I hated during that time You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished And your blatant disregard for the law made obvious months ago through your for the Melvin lawyers out there alleged illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08 And why would you Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions I bought shares a few days ago I dumped my savings into GME paid my rent for this month with my credit card and dumped my rent money into more GME which for the people here at WSB I would not recommend And I'm holding This is personal for me and millions of others You can drop the price of GME after hours $120 I'm not going anywhere You can pay for thousands of reddit bots I'm holding You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us I don't care I'm making this as painful as I can for you To CNBC you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that short term Your staple audience will soon become too old to care and the millions of us not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us and tried to tear down the little guys I know for sure I'll remember this In response here is a list of CNBC sponsors and partners They include but are not limited to IBM Cisco TMobile JPMorgan Oracle and ZipRecruiter Their parent company is NBCUniversal owned by Comcast and GE To the boomers and/or people close to that age just now paying attention to these millennial blog posts you realize that even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were We're not enemies we're on the same side Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers and start rooting for us because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago and we're taking that opportunity Your children your grandchildren might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against You really want to choose them over your own family and friends We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet We're just asking you to be understanding supportive and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago To WSB you all are amazing I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash Whether you're here for the gains to stick it to the man as I am or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement thank you Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance I've never felt this optimistic about the future before This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible I love you all x200B x200B Note I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that

Why the $GME MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) is real and why it is scary for the rest of the market,25631,m79wdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/,4332,1616041930.0,Why the $GME MOASS Mother of All Short Squeezes is real and why it is scary for the rest of the market So I tried to post this on r/investing and r/stocks but I don't think I meet their karma requirements so I am gonna start this post here This post is gonna be long and in order to understand it you need to understand how market makers works If you don’t understand that concept that’s fine A simple google search will yield sources better than me that can provide you a basic understanding of market makers and short selling So try doing a quick search to educate yourself then come back here The GME market wide Correlation So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market Hence when the market has major red days across multiple sectors GME is still green among a sea of red And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation When you align charts of GME since December with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq it’s like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest So why is this happening Well the simplified explanation is this When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions like Melvin capital for example it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called So for example when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position This is pretty basic stuff But this isn’t a normal Short Squeeze The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets was the fact that GME’s short percentage reached a height of 140 But what does a 140 float mean Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed Well yes that’s called naked shorting but it’s more complicated than that How Naked Shorts work When a naked short is created it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower So when you see 140 short percentage that doesn’t mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting it means when these institutions Melvin heavily shorted GME the Market Makers Citadel created shares out of thin air and tethered them to the real shares that were borrowed These made up shares are synthetic shares they don’t actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing sorry I don’t have a time stamp but today’s hearing is worth watching if you have the time The Big Short So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to “Synthetic CDO’s” from the 2008 crisis I’m using synthetic CDO’s as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie “The Big Short ” These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO’s So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money Now to talk about the current squeeze It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with Infinite risk This is how short squeezes happen if the price is driven up the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender which then further increases the price of a share and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post at $215/share but it’s price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up But here is the the important part The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the synthetic shares only become “real” when the short position completely closes or is margin called This means the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number So you don’t need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous once the synthetic shares come to fruition We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money But that doesn’t stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares So The MM’s are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb Now why it’s scary for the rest of the market So if you’ve been following to this point you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation I don’t think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in this short position So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs I’m talking in the billions of dollars across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee and I don’t think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost I believe with great conviction when GME truly takes off it will cause a major market wide correction across all sectors The Conclusion Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because the way these contract expiry dates are usually set the number of option contracts set around those dates And It’s possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time However I can say 2 things with absolute certainty We are witnessing history this whole thing is already resulting in many academic studies further government intervention and future movies/documentaries There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again I do not care what broker you have fidelity E TRADE Schwab or robinhood etc They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys and very possibly sells just like RH did on January 28th When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January THIS WILL NOT BE THE BROKERS FAULT THE MARKET MAKERS AND HEDGE FUNDS SHOULD BE THE ONES FOOTING THE BILL EVEN IF THAT MEANS SELLING OFF EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THEIR BUILDING TO DO SO Mainstream Brokers only have so much money to provide the liquidity needed to move billions of trades a day they are not equipped to deal with something this insane So Why did I type up this long ass post If you think I’m just a crazy person that’s fine I don’t take it personally I’m just making this post because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders I know GME is a “meme stock” so it’s easy to discredit and it’s fun watching this David vs Goliath story but I believe this will have very real effects across the whole market so proceed with caution on your trades until this squeeze reaches a conclusion ESPECIALLY IF YOU DEAL WITH NAKED OPTIONS If you read this whole thing thanks Please let me know if there is any corrections I should make TLDR just skim the bold points ya lazy fuck lol Edit gonna have to turn off notifications now lol So I’m sorry if I don’t reply maybe later But most importantly I’m no professional I’m just a guy with an interest in the world of finance So don’t take this post as gospel I wanted to start this thread for the discussion and while I do strongly personally believe the MOASS is real I appreciated the counter points Thanks for the laughs and genuine discussion,2021-03-18 06:32:10,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

market and why it is still going to Disclaimer This is not financial advice and much of this information is not my own sourced from other DD’s many that have been removed As many of you know on the 17th of this month Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview Automod won't let me link it where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze However this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined Tom or should we go with Tommy goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse let’s play his game and ponder this idea for a second Tom states without the regulation brokers would have been obligated to deliver 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed 540 of shares Vlad CEO of RobinHood also told us that on the day of the halt they had an order volume of 3 Billion that they could not fulfill Tom continues the interview admitting that without the regulation GameStop stock would have surged into the thousands yes plural Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is Finra’s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78 46 However there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed For one Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest letting the synthetic longs drive this down Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up to date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now So what is the true short interest then Well let’s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024 Insider Ownership 23 704 787 Institutions 151 000 000 Funds 40 000 000 Retail 38 595 000 Total Owned 253 299 787 Total Outstanding 69 746 960 Percentage of ownership to outstanding 363 17 Estimated Synthetic Shares 183 552 827 FINRA Short of Float 78 46 Finviz Float 50 650 000 Reported Shares Shorted 35 538 624 Total Estimated Short Synthetic Reported 219 091 451 Percentage of Shorts to the Float 432 56 If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024’s data check out his DD But yes the short interest may be a whopping 432 56 Last week u/thabat ran an AI generated model of GME’s stock price which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme $130k a share Now I know lol Let’s not get ahead of ourselves That is a completely crazy fucking number I mean right It has to be But I mean if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world If SI really is 400 shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights If this is what our models show imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have This may very well be why they are so frightened They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us Without regulation this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes So now alongside our Dogfather Cohen we shall wait patiently for a catalyst Just like on the last squeeze to $483 we required a catalyst to get us there Don’t forget the information we knew in November and December Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of Cohen could up his stake Earnings in March Who knows what could happen It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world and we are still in its infancy Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not We are basically right back where we were in November/December The stock price does not matter If short interest is at 400 or if short interest is at 80 Both are insanely high SI values and a squeeze is inevitable one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50 000 With high short interest a squeeze is inevitable NEVER forget that So continue to hold fellow apes May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel 💎🙌 Edit Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also admitted that they halted to save themselves Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it WAS NOT a liquidity issue but that is his reasoning now You can find these 2 interviews on youtube AutoMod wont let me link youtube Edit 2 XRT short interest is up 20 this week reaching 199 SI 🤔🤔 more proof of the artificial price drops ,2021-02-20 11:29:17,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,34274,lbaktb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/,3593,1612339673.0,SOBER REVIEW TIME what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today Edit There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go or make a followup tomorrow First off my position 1900 shares of GME 30 plus 5 calls $250 Peak value was nearly 500k This is not financial advice I'm not an expert etc WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity and sticking it to the man and 'fuck it I'm down so much anyway' NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold Here's our biggest problem Misinformation There is a lot of information being spread around like manure Mostly unread mostly un disseminated basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now That is what I intend to review and hopefully gather from you apes here today A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME 1 Fundamental Value This isn't relevant right now GME is presently a $20/share company even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model When that happens the value will go up for now 30 above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture 2 Momentum This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share and the biggest reason we're still at $90 way above fundamental value Here's something to consider Momentum not the squeeze is why the share price is where it is rather the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard But people are also idiots Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure and can be easily manipulated as we've seen 3 THE SHORT SQUEEZE What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices Short sellers who are actually not theoretically pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss and en masse If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called If/when they exited they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest to the point that they were straight up given a multi billion dollar bailout by their competitors These people don't play by the same rules as you you fucking braindead monkey 4 The Gamma Squeeze Last Friday for the second Friday in a row a vast majority of calls expired In The Money and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today T 2 rule The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough and so didn't actually own enough underlying shares to hand over and now need to rush to buy them at market price Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon Maybe But a gamma squeeze can also backfire All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy or the margin to borrow That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace 5 Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh best believe it happened and is still happening Just to review the hits 1 DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere 2 Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling 3 A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver 4 Retail brokers cancelling orders restricting limit prices enforcing unwanted stop losses eToro 5 Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands x200B OK BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY x200B No really I'm asking Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information I will edit and update this list as information is shared Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can Argument 1 The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high Claim As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float there is a supply problem for short sellers This may translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time driving the squeeze Evidence needed What is the current short interest S3 partners provides estimates using a model and as of today claim it is only 51 of free float Source x200B Ortex data provides another estimate using another model and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares only a million shares difference from S3Source x200B REAL DATA The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month The most recent data we have is from Jan 15 and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27 On Jan 15 the SI was 131 The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9 Frankly we can't rely on the REAL data because it's delayed too long to be relevant Evidence needed What is the actual free float I still need help finding this I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days If 27 million shorts still need to close how many shares are readily available Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46 89 mil shares FWIWSource Argument 2 There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close Claim assuming 27 mil shorted not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions Evidence Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today Date Trade Volume 2/2 Tue 77 8m 2/1 Mon 37 3m 1/29 Fri 50 5m 1/28 Thu 58 5m 1/27 Wed 93 3m Argument 3 Short Sellers will are under pressure to close so the squeeze is coming Claim Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions and will eventually prefer or be forced to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze Evidence needed Shorts are on average in a losing position at current share price $90 and can't just close right now at profit Evidence needed Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further x200B Argument 4 Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work and retailers didn't sell off en masse creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply Claim Price dips happened during low volume trading short ladder market manipulation etc and the longs are holding fast Counterevidence THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS Evidence This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio Source Counterargument Order counts don't mean shit For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller So 100k buyers buy one share each and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each and there are less buyers than sellers overall WHO KNOWS This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders Evidence needed Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold Evidence needed other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders Fidelity is just one broker and a retail broker at that Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity x200B Argument 5 The biggest dips were driven by short ladder attacks during low volume periods Claim the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling short ladders and not so much by change in momentum Evidence At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors Essentially round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices Counterargument short ladder attacks are straight up not real conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself Evidence needed I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts 100 shares at a time could use that Counterargument The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker Damage to momentum was done but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip right Evidence needed That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume I'm seeing a lot especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression x200B Argument 6 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart' Claim See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up That's us right now Evidence A single solitary chart Counterargument the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90 of the float check me on that fact I'm repeating secondhand info See the big dip AFTER the squeeze How do we know we aren't there Evidence needed IDK some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play x200B x200B Will edit with more my primate fingers are hurting from trying to press the keys and my handler needs to readjust my helmet ,2021-02-03 10:07:53,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)",40258,ldjbg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/,3571,1612593568.0,Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday Why They Didn't Cover on Friday and Why They Want You to Think They Did GME Fellow Apes I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such I know you guys can't read but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this 🚀🚀🚀 Part 1 What Happened on the 28th As we all know last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze This is a significant day because it broke momentum and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis Here is a tweet from Ihor S3 stating the short interest data as of the 28th Per S3 Short Interest was 62 9M as of the 27th and 57 8M as of the 28th The net SI is 57 8M 62 9M 5 08M This means the net short position reduced by 5 08M shares however many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down Well lets say that's what happened and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly We will also assume this happened in a vacuum i e retail did not contribute to any volume so that we can get a liberal estimate To establish a short position at a higher price hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482 85 If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling than they would have opened 15 8M more short positions 10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350 and the remaining 5 8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480 This means that if shorts added to their position at this time the best they could have done is add 15 8M short positions at an average $300 This is assuming no covering was done during this period of time which is highly unlikely considering the price went up Now during the freefall following RH trade restrictions there was only 10 4M in volume If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price they would have only been able to cover 10 4M positions and 5 7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300 only 4 7M could have been between $300 and $112 This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time and it doesn't even account for that fact that covering would drive the price up not down Lastly after the nosedive there was a bounce of 9 2M in volume If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average they would only be able to add 9 2M at an average of $250 Once again however adding positions would have drove the price down not up So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of $280 while covering only 10 4M at exorbitant costs This likely didn't happen for several reasons First S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading however they would be at non ideal prices Second this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass the price would increase not decrease and when shorts sell en mass the price would decrease not increase Third this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother also highly unlikely given the hype at the time Fourth in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share and we know that at that time GME was hard to borrow What is more likely is the inverse of the above which would mean shorts covered 15 8M shares at an average cost of $300 then short sold 10 4M shares at an average of $250 before further covering 9 2M at an average of $250 Despite ideal circumstances that is not an ideal result for hedge funds That means hedge funds are not kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points that would be impossible Part 2 What About Last Friday Now this was an important day GME fought hard and closed at above $320 What makes this day confusing however are the claims that short interest drastically decreased Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question you can look into those on your own What I want to go over is how could it be remotely possible S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th however the share price had a net decreasing trend There were only 2 notable upward rallys and combined they only account for 24M shares If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves Where did the other 6M shares go I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday Also note that Short Volume was 17 6M on Friday So on Friday there was 50M in volume 17 6M of that volume was due to shares sold short so SI would be 57 8 SI as of the 28th 17 6M shares sold short 75 4M In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as S3 said it would have required the covering of 75 4M 27M 48 4M shares How do you cover 48 4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17 6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares At most 32 4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position which would make SI 75 4M 32 4M 43M It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday so the actual SI is likely much higher Furthermore I want to draw attention to other times shares were covered and their effect on the price and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday S3 claims that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th the SI went from 69M to 62M a decrease of 7M shares On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43 an 100 increase They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50 From the 25th to the 27th there was literally exponential growth in the share price despite no change in SI But then all of a sudden on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price How could that be remotely accurate There was 50M in volume on the 29th how could the purchase of 31M shares by a single entity not even accounting for retail result in a net decrease in share price Part 3 How Could They Do It Read this post and the sources within it in detail Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered when they have not There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases you do the math Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD Why are there bots everywhere in WSB Shorts haven't covered they can't cover and they wont They also did not shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances They want you to think they covered they also want you to think they have a better short position They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover nor could they find enough shares to reposition They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail TLDR Seriously read this whole thing I know you won't but do it Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday it would have been impossible based on volume alone They want you to think they did they need you to but they did not Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to

$GME $300 maybe you can explain it to them like this There's a rich kid in town Let's call him Melvin He thinks he's really smart He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units This is easy I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon Easiest $20 I'll ever make He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids He collects $200 each from 150 parents He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours His parents will be so proud There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time Let's call him Keith Keith doesn't like Melvin Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot Later in the day Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please Gamestop guy looks at him and says Sorry we're all sold out Melvin goes to the next Gamestop Same story All sold out He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch He won't be able to fulfill the orders Meanwhile Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought no matter how much he offers you Nobody likes Melvin so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch Melvin is in trouble His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch Melvins parents are angry but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150 This is how you get a short percentage over 100 Melvin has promised more than actually exist The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends but they had to pay really inflated prices for them first $1 000 then $2 000 now $3 000 It's nearing Christmas and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one They all start bidding against each other for Switches Everybody in town is in on the action now Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10 000 Meanwhile Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing Edit 1 Thanks for all the love and awards I'm really grateful I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's Edit 2 A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles In a more accurate version Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours he will give them each $5 per day The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers This is a naked short He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation Although there are 250 Switches in the city there are now only 100 Switches in circulation Keith's friends So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available 150 short position of float Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case the day after and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty $450 He'll still have made $3 000 $450 $2 550 The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches the more expensive it's going to be for him After 4 days he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play They also know that the price of Switches is rising Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1 000 to cancel the IOU they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market In addition the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15 000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1 000 So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it it's very difficult ,2021-01-30

cannabis market to moon and how to avoid becoming a bag holder when this all comes crashing down Obligatory SIR THIS IS A CASINO This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form TLDR This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50 80 or more from the levels they are at $CRLBF is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation We just like the stocks now not later Ok listen up normies Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post Don't post DD if you have no clue Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL Not even kidding So I made a new account This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining what is actually going on CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you The hedge funds are playing these right along with us Don't ask me for proof this isn't Twitter Reasons why they are playing with us 1 When there is money to be made hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you 2 The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains all the while handing you guys the bags That's all you need to know So in response to all you posting real DD with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell I'm over it I can tell instantly how uninformed you are when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation These are Canadian companies Get your head back on straight You're here for the trade and the bet not for the fundamentals and if that's it then fine ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit and if not read on so you don't hold more bags This place has never been one to care for fundamentals but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS Let's take a look at some of today's gainers changed tickers for automod avoidance $USMJay Penny stock worth absolute nothing for a reason $SNDL Up ridiculous amount have a billion shares outstanding just diluted them all the other day $TeeRTeeC Terra Tech they grow weed from all indications do it poorly $OhGeeEye lol $HUGE Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has x200B Now if you're simply playing this to get in and get out great for you The people saying and believing $SNDL $10 EOW HOLD THE LINE and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless do not listen to them If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan congrats take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20 of what it is worth now Literally They're far worse than the main bunch CGC CRON ACB TLRY APHA but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either x200B THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING Tilray had 40 short interest It's not $GME level but it's pretty high When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off why though Notice this week's FD option chain x200B Tilray has a 95M share float those 42 calls represent roughly 1 5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves Previous to this run up that represents roughly 5 of the average daily volume of the stock BY ITSELF Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge They may get loaned out to be shorted but that will only speed up the squeeze here The important part Today 2/10/21 the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66 The most sold front week call $40/$42 strikes Premium when I screen shotted this $22 20 Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls in which case it may squeeze itself higher Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this sell you the calls shove the price up to keep selling you calls then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain dump back the shares to help shove the price down oh and did I mention They shorted the top x200B It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze That's it with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume likely re shorting on the way up and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total a massive volume of 200 million shares today You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500 and it may but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up Might it get there Sure But be prepare to take profits when it does because ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER Not to mention the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies with horrible fundamentals and poor prospects Oh what's that CGC got some CBD treats for Martha seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading If the dog treats get you excited about the stock Martha belongs here more than you do 200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads What to take away An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands or in other words fewer reason for people to bag hold Fewer people that have to hedge Fewer people that have to cover Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers and keep the price stable by holding and more reason it's going to collapse sooner or later But this IS a casino after all Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened oh you're new here Yeah this isn't the first time x200B Looks eerily familiar to something else recently Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe For those of you that are new THIS IS NOT NORMAL STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS You are in the infancy of a new age of trading but people still know fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on and these valuations are getting extremely overextended Eventually in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2 43 a share At $2 43/share I would have bought it Even at $10/12/14 At these levels You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn So in short again Sir this is a casino x200B Timeline of events and how to not become a bagholder 1 $APHA earnings are good stocks pop a bit and level off 2 Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis notice we will likely NOT get outright legalization just re scheduling 3 $CGC earnings are actually awful with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon 4 $TLRY gets a UK deal 5 $TLRY starts going insane since $APHA is a reverse merger with a 81 value share to share it starts pumping people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on overall strength 6 There's no strength there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum and a short squeeze on Tilray 7 This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down just like the second graph I posted There is no fundamental or even POSSIBILITY of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like Yep Profits 8 Finally how to not become a bag holder The market can stay irrational way way way longer than you expect So this may go on for a bit but refer back to 7 It's coming back down eventually set expectations and pick your exit or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run Eventually you have to sell to actually realize a gain don't forget that Once you do close the chart remove it from your watchlist check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares But if Tilray comes crashing back down $APHA will as well along with all of them and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price THIS IS ALL JUST SENTIMENT BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also who will also become bag holders x200B Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION IF ANYTHING IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS x200B Who are the real players Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF do your own DD or wait for a post next week x200B Conclusion Nobody should plan on holding these long term Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play You likely will not time the top Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade exit the trade or slowly shave your position close the graphs and don't fomo back in Just be done with the trade afterwards You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago and in that case you belong here congrats on your gains and fuck you THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE AND IT WILL END THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER And if you think WE are the ones driving the price up the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want You're holding a lit molotov the only question is will you throw it before it blows up The rest of you Plz fuck off with you 20 shares $2 on Sundial fuck off with the HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW fuck off with your fomo and fuck off with the movement and lets push this to the sky stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on You know what lets push this to the sky sounds like Market manipulation We're not in this together I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month eventually that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it I ain't tipping you either These prices are insanely high for these companies The multiples are out of control and if you buy in at these levels well best of luck I hope it works out for you I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains and will continue to put my money elsewhere SIR THIS IS A CASINO Positions I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1 000 tomorrow and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent Disclaimer I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down x200B x200B Edit You know what I forgot to add Some of the biggest holders the cannabis ETFs and funds you know what they did today They trimmed their positions And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de concentrate shares into the retail's hands the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent Edit 2 Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill I had thousands of shares these are just the trades from this month and I'm not advocating a buy I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in You want the gain numbers You do the math I'm not your math tutor I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb Yeah I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person Edit 3 I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019 Yes it's the real SoRefreshing proof Edit 4 Eh don't request me with What should I do with XX be a big adult grown up and decide your own risk tolerance and exits I responded to the first 10 or so Now I have 100 I can't I disabled chat messages Edit 5 jesus with the awards go buy TSLA calls this is WSB not fb/twtr disclaimer have TSLA calls Edit 6 Oh look they're pinning it around the $42 strike Go figure ,2021-02-11 16:54:35,CRLBF:NULL,,,,,,,,,,

"I teach high school, which means I explain things to idiots every day. If you still don't understand call options, I got you.",49120,m4a87a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/,3064,1615683365.0,I teach high school which means I explain things to idiots every day If you still don't understand call options I got you I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them So here you go Note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified WHAT IS A CALL OPTION BASICS A call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date Example You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th What that means is that at any time between now and end of day on 3/19 you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400 If the price spikes to $700 dollars you can still buy them for $400 That's a pretty good deal So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even and anything above that is profit right Not quite You have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract The premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a $2 premium that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract which means that you pay $200 the buy the call $2/share x 100 shares You give the seller $200 and they give you the call option Since you paid $200 for the option this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share Why Because if the price only got to $400 you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste However if the price goes to $403/share then you make a profit because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share But what if the price doesn't go up or even goes down Do I have to still buy those shares for $400 No You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to Remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400 but not the obligation But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40 000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40 000 sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position Regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM or in the money What does that mean Let's look at some option vocabulary CALL OPTION VOCABULARY Strike Price This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract In our $400 call option above the strike price is $400 At any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock Exercise Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock In the example above you would spend $40 000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock No If you can't afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else Expiration Date This is when your call expires if you have a 3/19 expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19 Premium The premium is the price you pay to the call seller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share Knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of 25 If you do the math it will cost you $25 which is 25/share x 100 shares ITM and OTM In the Money and Out of the Money ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price If you have a $400 call and the price of GME goes to $405 then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400 If you then immediately sold the stock for $405 you'd make money OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350 then your call is OTM It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium if GME goes to $401 you are ITM because 401 400 but you haven't broken even yet because your break even price is $402 FDs FD is not an investment term and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls It is a WSB term and it stands for maggot's delight but with an F because autmod won't let me define FDs FDs are OTM calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble The guy who spent 90k on 1dte 1 day to expiration OTM GME calls Those were all FDs and they all expired worthless Why are they called FDs Because when you buy FDs you usually end up taking it in the ass WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT You have probably seen something like this GME $400c 3/19 Let's break it down GME $400c 3/19 The GME stands for Gamestop which you probably figured out The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400 If it said $400p it would be a put option but we'll talk about those later The 3/19 stands for the expiration date Now let's make it more complicated If I said I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19 what do I mean It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration and I paid $5 per share If I paid $5 per share how much did I spend on my contracts I spent $5 000 $5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts Now you try it A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share How would you explain to me that you bought two of them You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19 Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS This is confusing Why do people even do this People buy call options because you can make a lot of money If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price then for every $1 the share price goes above your break even price you make $100 If you have a $400c with a break even of $402 and the price gets to $412 then you make $1 000 profit That's $10 of profit $412 $402 times 100 shares You can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money It is usually better to sell the contract but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS When you buy a stock at least you own the stock If you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME / 5 depending on when he bought on Thursday Instead he has nothing WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING So you bought a call option and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money That's because there are actually two types of value in an option options have Intrinsic Value and Extrinsic Value Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option If you own a $400c and the price is $412 then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share or $1200 because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up Pretty easy Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility For example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM because more time more chances for the price to rise Therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration Conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases This is called theta decay but you don't need to worry about that Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM This is reflected in a measurement called IV or Implied Volatility Like Theta Decay IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics Due to the factors of time theta and volatility IV constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time This is why the value of your option will constantly change Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility Your option value will decrease as IV drops Is the stock starting to jump around Your option value will increase as IV increases Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing Why do you think that is If the stock value is increasing slowly but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS You can sell your contracts at any time You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts This is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290 If he had sold then he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button They get your money and you get their shares This can take some time OK I GET IT BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price To buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit The End SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY No You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous Don't go crazy Buy a call See how it works for real Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge Or do Live your life how you want I'm not your dad Just make sure you post the

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,48807,lalucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/,2395,1612263785.0,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions TLDR Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit They've been illegally closing out their short positions and if we hold they will 100 get fucked There is far more nefarious shit at play So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above 120 short interest still I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close 50 of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week This got me digging around to figure out what's up I started by looking into GME failed to delivers i e short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan GME had 1 2 MILLION failed to delivers This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying What was interesting though is that of that 1 2million 700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road Having spent some time looking at the pattern it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in then a small chunk of coverage then another large amount and so on To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article In it a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME Assuming that XYZ e g GME is a hard to borrow security e g apes holding strong and that Trader A Melvin or its broker dealer is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker dealer’s close out requirement but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale Most often this is done through the use of a buy write trade but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions ” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close out a fail The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen in combination with the ladder attacks My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th I 100 think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud In fact I would bet all my money on it oh wait I did 96 GME 290 I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail More DD Not a financial adviser I eat paint chips for dinner EDIT Ok so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million What I'm doing is summing all the debits to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about 10M We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect I got mixed around when I wrote this initially The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was 80 The 120 figure for S3 was correct Please checkout the linked DD it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can Share this post and the related DD We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening If I take an L to 0 I take an L to 0 I don't invest what I can't lose But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open WE LIKE THE STOCK 💎🖐️,2021-02-02 13:03:05,GME:NULL,0,,,,,,,,,

GME - POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF,18378,lxwhpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/,2318,1614923733.0,GME POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options TL DR the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball Here is what I did Pulled the option chain data into excel ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info What is a gamma squeeze For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5 Gamma squeezes revolve around options I wont go into too much detail here on what those are but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM in the money of course the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME $15 goes to $150 Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge which of course will cause that price to rise more and more Now that GME is $130 Today was a great day GME closed up $8 17 or 6 58 maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for but on a down market day is pretty incredible Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait GME Options Exp 2021 03 05 This Friday GME $100 Last Fridays Close Option Expiry At this level going into Friday we could expect 22 427 in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised About 2 242 700 to be exact or about 4 97 of the TOTAL FLOAT Crazy GME $130 We can expect 35 989 contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130 A solid 13 562 more contracts than at the $100 level This equates to 3 598 900 shares or 7 97 of total float Now we're getting nutty What about GME $150 Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM In fact closing above this price means there would be 46 397 contracts ITM This means that a whopping 4 639 700 shares or 10 27 of total float MORE THAN DOUBLE $100 What does this mean Well not every contract will be exercised even ITM These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised 10 of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand it means more contracts will come ITM next week and then more again the week after and so on With the steady price rise we've been seeing it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME There's been crazy volume at times particularly today the day before contract expiry Any how ill put away my tinfoil hat What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning the first domino's Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond No not really but it sure does increase the odds of that happening We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves We all saw what happened with RH and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took its just the action that we were able to see Summary Since last Friday 2021 02 26 last option expiry the number of contracts possibly ITM has DOUBLED I repeat DOUBLED If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised 10 of total float will be called on Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close $130 there is still 50 more contracts ITM than last week All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big x200B Ill say it again for those in the back DOUBLED Mic drop Not financial advice this is just for fun Any questions feel free to ask away ,2021-03-05 07:55:33,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

clear the air here regarding GME AMC CLOV Alright you retards I'm taking the initiative to clear the air I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes but I'm going to be straight up honest here We are not a team this is not a cult and this is not fucking collusion GME AMC CLOV are three completely different plays Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude GME Was being shorted because as per technicals it was a company that was going to shit bankruptcy if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E Commerce and the like Additionally the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of 140 Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur The stock picked up gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day Why because the remaining 15 20 short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses thus still considered a major play the company making big changes to their board of directors adding e commerce and more etc AMC This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME The SI on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20 This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in AMC due to the retail investors Picking this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success hopefully When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company Again the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail Now the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses Also seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID 19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again thus making AMC still a very big play CLOV Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO This had nothing to do with GME or AMC The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub segment that hasn't changed in ages This stock has a large short interest now probably greater then AMC and GME combined low float no debt and has a very bright future for growth It's also heavily invested by Alphabet Google and other major players The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC separate that from your minds Yes Melvin Capital Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC but this has no relevance to CLOV No one gives a fuck a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV That's it simple as that All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays Yes a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock But get this through your heads THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY They are completely different in respect to each other WSB is a casino we're here to place bets and hope for the best This is not a team sport this is not a cult and this is not collusion If you don't like a stock then don't throw money at it But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole most of you are chill af just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC Now with this shit said I'm a big supporter of all 3 But for fuck sakes they are not the same play stop comparing the 3 Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved Everyone needs to chill the fuck out play your plays and keep it moving Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all BB and NOK became Meme stocks because fundamentally they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future People just need to stop comparing and having these debates 3 stocks 3 completely different plays fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous Also the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up people bag holding these stocks will sell why Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills mortgages/rent their children etc and with the cost of living cost of commodities inflating due to inflation I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions shorting these stocks until this occurs They're banking that when shit goes tits up the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs My personal opinion Some plays on WSB are value plays short squeeze plays gamma squeeze plays undervalued plays oversold plays etc the fucking list goes on WSB is a god damn casino so treat it as such I wish you all the best and many tendies regardless of what you're invested in Downvote me to oblivion idgaf Important update I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards upvotes and comments I want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post When I was referring to 15 20 short sellers for GME I was not referring to short interest or the naked shorts everyone is talking about Simply that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet same goes for AMC and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330 I wasn't talking about the big MOASS I've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself I was here before there was 500k members I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock/investment subreddits etc Hopefully this clears some shit up Again the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this cult like attitude/behaviour Oh and the reason why my post mentions GME AMC CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made 07/06/2021 Cheers ,2021-07-06 21:06:24,"GME:Rise,AMC:NULL,CLOV:NULL",1,0,,,,,0,,,
"The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME’s real price is $2,147,483,737",16525,lc2dpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc2dpx/the_anatomy_of_a_short_escalator_omega_overflow/,2112,1612426129.0,The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack why GME’s real price is $2 147 483 737 Hey diamond hands as I am sure you have heard there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME While I held this belief for many days I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us I mean seriously there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price None The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack No it was far worse Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you If you can understand a short ladder attack you can understand this tactic as well Basically a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack or Overflow attack for short is the opposite of a short ladder attack In a short ladder attack shares are traded back and forth with each trade a penny lower In an overflow attack the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices How high you ask $2 147 483 648 That's right hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs Why this price though It's simple Every investment app RH TD etc use 32 bit integers to store prices The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2 147 483 647 So what happens when it goes up by one It goes negative This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth $2 147 483 647 What do you think this does to the price of a stock If you answered bad things you are correct The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives Didn't think that stocks could go negative I'm not surprised that's another hedge fund secret They don't tell you THAT on investopedia But as the critical thinkers you are I'm sure you will now ask Why isn't the stock price negative right now The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze but it happened and it was big So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself MATH TIME So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze But by how much Well we know that the price right now is $90 But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration If there is $2 147 483 557 of pressure on prices then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2 147 483 647 90 or $2 147 483 737 Yes EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2 147 483 737 We can't forget about overflow however so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually $1 073 741 734 Now this might sounds like a scary number but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine As long as you keep holding the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors it's only a matter of time And as a side note If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars At this point buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement So as the wise investors on WSB say BUY WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS Edit please stop messaging me look at the flair on the post man This is not financial advice I swear to God please don't let the SEC take me away Positions 0 GME,2021-02-04 10:08:49,GME:NULL,0,,,,,,,,,

GME and $80 Stocks.

today with Robinhood and what it means for short squeezing investors I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize rather than be upset Worked Merrill as an analyst from 2014 2016 I also like to keep it concise so follow along This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction Disclaimer I own GME This is not financial advice This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies 1 Robinhood restrictions suppression When you place an order through RH Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread However the transaction is not complete Enter Clearing house The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter parties Because they stand between sellers buyers they have very defined levels of risk risk management and regulation to be in front of The clearing house is who gives you the title for your shares the folks who make it official What Likely Happened The risk department retard the clearing house who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C Suite frazzled He has looked at option open interest expiring this week has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway shape or form turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert It's simply not enough In addition they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey if you fucking keep selling open positions you're on your own we ain't gonna help you SEC is sneaky like that they like sending messages through the backdoor not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves If you're not following Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists So they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME there simply isn't enough float the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a failure to deliver 2 Failure to Deliver This is a pretty fucking big deal Bigger than you imagine because it's basically a slam dunk law suit Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties in this case the firm who sold you the option RH or the clearing house has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position profit or certificate Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered There simply isn't enough for everyone Thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of failures to deliver big risk 3 Liability You must be asking so what Fuck them They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me the customer the right to choose or whatever the fuck That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions If they fail to they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER How many people have options on GME on RH Half Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house There would be no Robinhood left There would likely be no clearing house left Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T Mobile they had to pull the plug Hence Bad Decision Bankruptcy or worse WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH there's definitely coordination all around but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal Couple of semi related notes Fuck Billionaires Parasites of modern society simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people them in the streets them in the them from skyscrapers Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel the HF would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC They cleared over 6 billion net last year so just logically it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel simply because it's such a money maker If you were an evil genius would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short The media just wants clicks and engagement so they will bring the worst people on simply to pad their own bottom line Don't get engaged Don't give in to them Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall street however you please The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive not reactive TL DR There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened hence restrictions What will happen now Based on my previous short squeezes Friday tomorrow will be nuts All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float I'm guessing up up up up up

GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile,17056,lb7ndd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb7ndd/gme_liquidy_is_drying_up_causing_the_share_to/,1656,1612331555.0,GME liquidy is drying up causing the share to become more and more volatile I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from this savant's post As the free flowing stock dries up due to ppl buying and holding the volatility increases It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money As long as you keep holding and buying the volatility will only increase Expect huge swings in the next few days Hedge funds know this They tanked the stock this morning Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable to make it look like the ride is over HOWEVER The short float is still high and the volume has been steadily decreasing Furthermore institutional ownership only picked up about 12m shares and some of those went to institutions that were long not short Now maybe I'm misreading this or maybe they're fudging the data but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume ACTIVE POSITIONS HOLDERS SHARES New positions 46 12 880 726 Sold out positions 34 3 412 841 Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short interest than is currently in GME The main problem is that retail investors unlike huge firms can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure rather than a sudden event The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope and this stock is still extremely volatile Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price Disclaimer I am a poker player not a day trader In poker this is what we call an implied odds play The risk is relatively small for us bulls relative to the short position but the expected value is potentially huge if it works But these plays are still risky despite being EV You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance This is pure uneducated speculation not financial advice TL/DR Grit your teeth and brace for swings Shit's about to get nuts Edit deleted the thing about being put on the short restriction list I screwed up the dates and added the institutional ownership thing ,2021-02-03 07:52:35,GME:Drop,2,,,,,,,,,

"With regard to the ""they're just defining a short squeeze"" and ""this language is common in SEC filings"" response to the GME 10-K

and this language is common in SEC filings response to the GME 10 K filing Here's the thing about legal filings and CYA turns of phrase the lawyers who craft these documents do so based on precedent and are encouraged to reuse legal terms as much as possible in order to avoid misinterpretation Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10 K filings for specific phrases Let's see just how common this language is shall we First the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety x200B The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company For example on January 28 2021 our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra day trading high of $483 00 per share and a low of $112 25 per share In addition from January 11 2021 to March 17 2021 the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19 94 to as high as $347 51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7 060 000 to 197 200 000 shares During this time we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock In particular a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock further influencing volatility in its market price Additionally these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to and may continue to lead to extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock Those repurchases may in turn dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing This is often referred to as a “short squeeze ”A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders or the perception that these sales may occur may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline Our employees directors and officers and their affiliates hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders or the perception that such sales will occur may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws or pursuant to our securities trading policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of nonpublic material information we have no Total number of 10 K filings roughly estimated by the number of hits for the phrase report over five year 254 473 filings and ten year 513 510 filings periods x200B How often does extremely volatile appear in SEC 10 K filings The phrase is found in 968 of all 10 K filings in the past 5 years or 0 38 of all filings The phrase is found in 2 268 of all 10 k filings of the past 10 years or 0 44 of all filings x200B How often does short squeeze appear in SEC 10 K

years or 0 14 of all filings The phrase is found in 754 of all of all 10 k filings of the past 10 years or 0 15 of all filings x200B How often do insiders appear in SEC 10 K filings The phrase is

that such sales will occur appear in SEC 10 K filings The phrase is found in 67 of all 10 K filings in the past 5 years or 0 026 of all filings The phrase is found in 109 of all 10 k filings of the

GameStop: Why this time is different- Open letter to WallStreet and CNBC,22789,l8oig7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8oig7/gamestop_why_this_time_is_different_open_letter/,1607,1612051017.0,GameStop Why this time is different Open letter to WallStreet and CNBC Dear WallStreet and CNBC You have been calling this a speculative bubble that GameStop will ultimately crash down to earth and that the “little guys” are going to get hurt Jim Cramer wants us to “take your home run” and sell You use words like “fundamentals” and “valuations” and says that the stock price is not justified Here’s the fundamental I am an ER doctor that trained in inner city Detroit When I was a resident physician Obama was president During his presidency the quality of life of the predominantly African Americans in the city did not improve Despite Obamacare I saw little improvement in the health outcomes of the patients I worked with I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs overdoses and gang violence YOU have left these people behind I spent the last several years working in a small town in the Midwest when Trump was president During his presidency the quality of life of the predominantly white Americans also did not improve and have in fact worsened I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs overdoses and suicides These patients I care for are also people whom YOU have left behind With the pandemic I have seen those who are already at the brink of financial solvency lose their jobs and I see lines outside food banks I see the health outcomes of my patients decline as they forego preventive care I on the other hand kept my job got a raise and saw the value of my 401k rise as the economy crashed around me Going to work every day is a constant and stark reminder of the brokenness and disparity of the economic system and my sheer powerlessness to change it I realize now that it is not political It is YOU I own GameStop because represents something to me It is the very embodiment of the millennial generation that you have left behind a down and out aging retailer that you feel is no longer worth investing in We ARE GameStop We are not selling because we believe in ourselves and investing in ourselves We WANT to see it succeed I am fully aware that I have benefited from having a 401k and it is what is supporting your industry But this also means that YOU work for ME I fully expect you to fuck over my generation to save yourselves by running to the politicians and regulators that you have bought to stop the squeeze and get them to suspend trading on $GME It is not lost on us that the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that you paid Janet Yellen $800 000 in speaking fees You will tell them that this is a “systemic risk” and that this will “crash the entire financial system” You will remind them what happened after they let Lehman Brothers fail in 2008 Don’t If you are a politician or a regulator reading this don’t listen to their bullshit If you intervene stop trading of $GME bail out hedge funds and big banks like you have in the past and try to placate us by dragging a few hedge fund managers in front of a congressional hearing you’ll unite the entire country against YOU Make sure you are on the right side of this You work for US too This country is broken and fractured You have goaded us into tearing each other apart for years This is the first time that I have seen the entire country rally behind a single cause You have given us a reason to unite against you and the system you have built and upheld I own GameStop not because Diamond Hands I own GameStop because I AM GameStop I am choosing to invest in my generation and selling would be selling myself out ,2021-01-31 01:56:57,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,29187,l7xj5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/,1581,1611968061.0,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved There is a prevailing mis understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the market price This is false You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order The idealized scenario is that GME rallies Melvin covers and everyone at reddit gets out at the top This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics Melvin will cover before we truly know it and the crash will happen as quick as the rally So with recent events you must ask yourself Who is Your Counterparty Nothing is a sure bet How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is Thousands of redditors new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't exited their trade This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms although their estimates differ some amount Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened It's tough to know for sure Know Everyone's Hand Your guess on how much they've covered and when they covered has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze The difference between the two represents your effective edge Remember we don't actually know Melvin's current position We don't know what's going on behind closed doors We only know the hand they're showing us via media Has their clearing firm taken over Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position Have they been buying since Monday Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath The pot is worth $25 billion dollars Ken Griffin has never lost Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Deutsche are not used to losing well Deutsche is They will do whatever it takes to take the pot from you and leave you holding the bag They will not blink twice because there is a lot of fucking money on the line Know What Can Go Wrong Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week Prepare yourself for the unexpected Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time The stock could be halted for days You could be assigned on ITM options Your stock could get delisted Your stock may get diluted Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose This one is self explanatory Your investment could go to zero Even if you think you make money on every trade if your bet size is 100 the long term value of your portfolio is zero Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital If you are new you really don't know the gut wrenching stomach turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative It fucking sucks You just know the highs You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies wrapped in anti billionaire pro underdog themes It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance We love the feeling If you are fully invested financially emotionally you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price Make feeling good your goal and set limits that you can stomach There are several feel good stories of people making life changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries Please think twice about this and only spend what you can afford to lose If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying you may have a gambling problem These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending Secondly don't take it personal There are people on the other side of your trades your brokerage support line the subreddit the media They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge It's easy to blame a broker yell at their support desk hate tweet at a company or even rage text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade A lot of people across the industry are rooting for you Fuck even Ted Cruz and AOC are rooting for you because this transcends politics If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008 keep it that way They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction brokerages the media and reddit If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers keep it that way Thirdly if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side be a human being for your wallet's sake You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions ,2021-01-30 02:54:21,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.,11110,lj5oyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj5oyo/why_gamestop_and_ryan_cohen_will_win_dd_no/,1526,1613268544.0,Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win DD No Diamond Hands Required Alright apes and autists let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe On November 16 2020 Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers In it Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes The Mission Statement GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology first companies that specialize in gaming products experiences and services The Landscape Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2 5x since the last console cycle The global gaming market expected to be $174 9 billion this year and reach $217 9 billion by 2023 Valuable Assets Existing strong brand and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand increases awareness and strengthens its base Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members Large retail and physical footprint The Roadmap Evolve into a Technology first company Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another GameStop will have to begin building a powerful e commerce platform that provides competitive pricing broad gaming selection fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming GameStop will have to hire the right talent So far Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team more on that later Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors Create a marketplace of wanted products and services i e Amazon Target App Store Provide and expand larger gaming catalogs Capture all games Create community experiences This could be both physical and digital experiences Provide streaming services New vertical opportunity for content creation tournaments and others Support Esports Expanding scene that is not going away Transition to Digital Industry developments in recent years include transition from physical hardware to digital streaming and the explosion of mobile Expand digital content This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam Blizzard App Store etc Allow online trade ins This would be a game changer Cut Excessive costs Cut its excessive real estate costs and identify duplicative under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals Streamline Non core operations in Europe and Australia in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash Near term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future The Financials Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick and mortar business If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports not factored into this calculation for now GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue however it is currently valued at a $3 5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3 3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion Chewy makes roughly $4 8B in Revenue losing money but growing quickly and is valued at $44B in Market Cap Target and Chewy are valued at 1 25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop Obviously this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors but given these metrics GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1 032 a share based on a current revenues Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue If GameStop can grow revenues focus on digital to improve margins and expand within the growing total addressable market I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy like multiples The X Factor I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy Otherwise I do not believe he would have joined the Board In his letter Ryan simply stated that RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten member Board It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model He is hiring digital and e commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession this will be a great opportunity to win Furthermore I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop Digital e commerce streaming and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm but execution will be key Ryan owns nearly 10 of GameStop so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake So degens I say think

Important Connection Between UFOs and Defense Stocks. *PLEASE READ I BEG OF YOU*,2686,n9zlpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9zlpn/important_connection_between_ufos_and_defense/,1498,1620775613.0,Important Connection Between UFOs and Defense Stocks PLEASE READ I BEG OF YOU TLDR The U S Government has confirmed several sightings of UFO's possibly aliens Several government officials have come out and said that U S military has had several encounters with physics defying vehicles Based off this evidence defense stocks have a direct relationship with UFO disclosure I recommend purchasing U S defense stocks due to recent UFO activity and human emotions PLEASE READ THIS POST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME This is my first time posting on this subreddit I hope this post can be welcomed with open arms like many other posts on this platform This is a rather long post but it is definitely the most important one for not only this subreddit but Earth as a whole I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered realistic by some of you Again this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched The issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra dimensional beings and crafts on Earth This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related However I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post I first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief Haim Eshed announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a Galactic Federation where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand the fabric of the universe Around this time America's former president Donald Trump established the seventh branch of their military the Space Force Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation He even says that Trump was on the verge of disclosing their existence however he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause mass hysteria due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide COVID 19 and degrading international relationships Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible reliable high ranking and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest ranking officials It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit Not only that but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011 He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that if I had come up with what I’m saying today five years ago I would have been hospitalized In the end he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has nothing to lose I’ve received my degrees and awards Again this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three time recipient of the Israel Security Award Here is the original Jerusalem Post article PLEASE READ Jerusalem Post Article In December of 2017 the New York Times published an article entitled Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’ The Pentagon’s Mysterious U F O Program This article was one of the first publications to give an in depth investigation of the current state of U S intelligence about UFO's unidentified flying objects or UAP's unidentified aerial phenomenons as they are known today by the U S Government In the NYT report it provides evidence to prove the U S Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings According to Defense Department officials included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program AATIP The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012 However when the program's backers were asked about it they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue New York Times Article PLEASE READ One of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U S military aircrafts Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled FLIR1 GIMBAL and GOFAST The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt All three of these videos show cockpit display data infrared imagery and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and impossible aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time One of the fighter pilots Commander David Fravor who was part of the F/A 18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004 had only this to say to the New York Times “I have no idea what I saw It had no plumes wings or rotors and outran our F 18s ” Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as not behaving by the normal laws of physics Furthermore he described the UAP to not be behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move In addition to this bizarreness all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature fumes or even a propulsion system Overall these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community FLIR1 Video Evidence GIMBAL Video Evidence GOFAST Video Evidence Although these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007 as they were being passed around in various website forums It wasn't until September of 2019 when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100 real and recorded by Navy aviators She also added that this was part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years This was one of the first incidences of the U S Government confirming that unknown and physics defying air crafts have entered U S airspace Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative More recently in April of 2021 a new video published by Mystery Wire showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U S Navy destroyer in night vision The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics defying maneuvers Additionally what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were transmedium vehicles meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly Also three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a sphere an acorn and a metallic blimp Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos Susan Gough the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that “I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations ” As you can see this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U S Government is hiding from its citizens Confirmed Pyramid UAP Video Sphere UAP Photo Acorn UAP Photo Metallic Blimp UAP Photo Pentagon Confirmation Article Now you may be asking yourself what happens now Well in last years' gargantuan $2 3 trillion appropriation bill that was mainly for COVID 19 relief aid for millions of Americans contained a rider that was provided by the Senate Intelligence Committee For anyone that doesn't know a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it In this case the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U S Government knowns about UAP's The small provision in the 5 500 page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U S Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a UFO report What do you think I'd love to hear your opinion UFO Disclosure Article While this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest ranking individuals on this planet This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future These events could be increased UFO sightings more government confirmations of UAP encounters or even extraterrestrial contact Overall what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra dimensional beings by the general public Based off human emotion people will not take this news lightly I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns knives and ammunition Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news Additionally there will be a massive pushback against the U S Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off world threat However this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life What I stated above sounds absolutely horrific however our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably it is more of a question of when Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin $LMT Raytheon $RTX and Boeing $BA will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics The final scenario is that the U S military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U S military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government Again whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses Now if you can take one thing from this post it is that information is ESSENTIAL What the U S Government has held from its people is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth we deserve to have this information told to us in full Resources THESE RESOURCES ARE

How to play the upcoming market crash,3027,oe9ruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/,1471,1625499121.0,How to play the upcoming market crash So the market is going to crash harder than a Boeing without updated software soon It doesn't really matter what awesome thing you think you've stumbled onto it's going to go down hard The Fed has put the market on easy mode ever since the COVID crash but that's coming to an end soon So if you don't want to lose all your tendies in the coming storm listen up Oh what's that you say There won't be a market crash Hang on lemme drop a little knowledge on you 1 the RRP numbers RRP is the Reverse Repo Program the fed runs where banks and other institutions park money at the fed overnight in exchange for Treasuries then swap them back the next day This usually spikes at the end of quarters and the rest of the time is super low Over the last few months it's been skyrocketing to all time highs It hit $991 Billion this quarter end then after the Q2 checks ended it fell all the way to $731 Billion Why is this bad It means the banks either need collateral so bad they're putting this much up overnight to get it or they'd rather get an annualized return of 0 05 than anything else at a time when inflation is officially running at around 5 and unofficially as much as twice that This means they the smart money think a guaranteed loss of 4 95 /year is the best they can hope to do 2 The housing market is about to go boom in the bad way Right now we've got increasing prices tons of supply under construction combined with decreasing sales That's basically the perfect indicator of a bubble about to pop Also the end of the eviction moratorium is still waiting around the corner to dump millions of houses on banks that really don't want them and will be very motivated sellers This should have already happened but when Team Sleepy Biden got a look at the amount of doom coming they quickly punted the ball and emergency extended the eviction moratorium by another month to the end of July Kick that can all you want it's still there and just getting bigger 3 The commercial housing market is basically in the same place today as the residential market was in 2008 and banks are loaded to the tits with bad CMBS products If you're confused how this could happen again only a few years later it's pretty simple all the guys who did the MBS nonsense in '08 didn't face any penalties so they moved over to CMBS and started inflating the income of the businesses renting properties Now what has the pandemic done more than anything else Killed the small businesses and retail stores that make up the majority of tenants in said CMBS loans So you've got a bunch of companies that Amazon just put out of business not paying their rent anymore which means the places they were paying rent to are no longer paying their mortgage Combine that with many companies reducing their office footprints with hybrid work from home setups and CMBS go BOOM in the bad way 4 The signs they are the everywhere Every company that can is going public right now regardless of whether they make money or not This is one of those classic the top is in signs Retail is fomoing into the market in a big way Remember the line about how a guy knew the market was done when his shoeshine boy had stock tips Now it's your Uber driver and Pizza delivery guy 5 Margin debt is around $860 billion right now And that's just what's disclosed Remember Bill Hwang lost $20 billion and even more for Credit Suisse and Deutsche and Nomura Yeah none of that leverage was disclosed because it was all in swaps You think he's the only family office out there pulling stunts like that And don't even get me started on how much margin is tied up in the funny internet money Hell Binance lets people margin at 100 to 1 That's beyond insane So yeah huge amounts of margin mean whenever things take a turn for the worse they spiral really really fast 6 When in doubt zoom out We've had people posting hundred year and twenty year charts and the stock markets channel for months now They all show the top of the channel that makes the bad bounce down happen is being touched Elliot Waves and other kinds of TA all show the same thing we're about to go down way downtown like 1929 down 7 All time highs but 50 of stocks are under their 50 day moving average That's happened in six of the last seven trading days It's never happened in history more than 3 out of 5 days before and every single time was shortly followed by a massive massive crash The crash has already started for the smaller fish but the indexes are being propped up by the big names because money is de risking by fleeing to them hoping they'll survive 8 Student loans The moratorium ends on September 30 Meaning that in October all of a sudden the people most likely to spend money in the economy young mid to low level disposable income will see that spending ability completely wiped out all at once This is tens of millions of Americans who immediately won't be spending money at businesses And you know what the most common month for financial crashes is October which is right after September Finally you don't just have to take my word for it Here's a list of some prominent financial types calling for doom soon 1 Dr Michael J Burry 2 a whole bunch of other assholes who don't have his track record but are echoing it So how you do make money on the collapse of the market Don't try to pick companies and buy puts if you do that you have to root on stuff failing Buy calls on SPXS SQQQ and SDOW then you get to root for things going up I don't do posts very often but my first DD on the oil markets made a whole lot of you a bunch of money Here's another chance to do it again Positions 10x HYG 7/23 80p 10x SPXS 7/16 40c 10x SPXS 7/16 55c Honestly I don't know if these will print or not But on the day they expire I'll just roll them or buy more another month or two out and will continue to do so If you want to just buy and forget Jan 2022 calls are the safest thing I can think of Maybe this can gets kicked out past the summer but there is no way it makes it past this fall and the student loan spending cliff EDIT and TLDR Market go boom in bad way Bet against market to make tendies Money printer no work no more printed too much money make liquidity trap RRP evidence of liquidity overload EDIT2 First a lot of people in the comments don't like my positions I've had them for awhile and they have a very good chance to expire worthless but as I said I'll keep rolling them because I did the math and it's cheaper to keep rolling them than to just buy Jan 2022 calls The options markets prices don't make sense a lot of the time so I really recommend doing the math on buying calls and puts at various points instead of just blindly picking a date and rolling with it Second the banks are being propped up by bullshit For those of you who didn't know the stress test they recently passed a couple weeks ago so they could start issuing dividends It used data from October 9 2020 That's fucking insane There's an interview with the head of BofA where he's talking about something else and mentions completely unprompted assuming we pass the stress test and he looked stressed as fuck while saying it There's no way on god's green earth that Bill Hwang was the only one being as fucky with hidden leverage like swaps or who knows what in the funny money markets with things like tokenized stocks to hide naked call and put and swap positions I don't know what domino is going to start this rolling but I see a lot of those motherfuckers teetering The market right now is the Titanic and I'm telling you people there are a bunch of goddamn icebergs out there EDIT 3 since I've been getting some questions about what's wrong with the banks and the CMBS market here are two articles one from the Atlantic last summer and one from the Intercept published in April An excerpt from the Intercept piece In a study released last November they sampled almost 40 000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019 “Overall ” they write “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5 or more in 28 of loans ” This was just the average however Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS Goldman Sachs Citigroup and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse “having more than 35 of their loans exhibiting 5 or greater income overstatement ” This is just the same thing as the NINJA No Income No Job Application for residential mortgages in 2008 applied to commercial loans EDIT 4 Since I'm getting a lot of requests both in comments and DMs about it here is a follow up post that explains exactly what the fuck is wrong with the housing market and why it's going to blow the fuck up soon ,2021-07-05 18:32:01,NULL:NULL,,,,,,,,,,

Why Sentiment Has Turned Against You I want you to understand this Truly I like GameStop I like $GME I believe in the long term plan or what I/we think is the plan anyway I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case which they barely even pretend to have considered I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck My personal belief which I require nobody else to share is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do and their buying alone will drive the price up But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price or they'd have done so I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares That's what I believe and why I'm not holding positions right now I probably will in the future but my personal opinion is the time is not right I wrote these posts EDIT lol I just realized both of those posts aren't visible since they were removed by the mods They were pro retail and pro GME I want to see people make money on this Better yet I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS Further what Robinhood did as well as Webull Interactive Brokers E Trade EToro and tons of other brokerages did was fucked up Everybody here agrees But you guys are actually fucking insane We dont have a problem with the stock We have a problem with YOU Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing And that's okay But the new people 7 million new versus 1 5 million old have done the following Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME AMC BB and NOK Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots While you've realized there were bots that were bought you missed probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas that the bots were spamming NOK Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier I saw one person disagreeing with a long time and well respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist Short ladders Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder EVERY TIME You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days With zero understanding of market mechanics explaining to others why price action is fake Look how low volume is on this candle It's not a real drop the dip is fake Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 paperhand pussies for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1 500 Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum Denying Reality S3 partners is not lying to you They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult to obtain information on short interest Just because they're reporting that short of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you Spammed low effort memes and easily Googleable questions on the new submissions When your posts were taken down you posted AGAIN Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot

pretending they did via the use of options to illegally cover with synthetic long shares to break the squeeze Long post ahead but I encourage you to read the whole thing This is a re post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned I am re posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared particularly at this junction in time If you've seen this post before I would appreciate an upvote for visibility TLDR Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered specifically an illegal method/loophole to cover their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options Full details below There’s an insightful piece on TradeSmithDaily that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling driving the price down further releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels From TradeSmithDaily Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price in other words could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills and the longs were selling early giving the shorts a means to cover as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time because without a critical mass of long side holders selling into the market the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze ” From TradeSmithDaily The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market The tactics involved are not a secret In fact the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC knows all about such tactics and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013 The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close out Obligations ” You can read it here via the SEC website The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language but here’s a quick rundown If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options having sold the call options to someone else typically a market maker — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade This works because if a market maker buys options from an options writer the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function This is necessary under the current rules and the current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades As a result of the above transaction the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts legally initiated by the market maker so the market maker can hedge The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund It gets very complicated very fast But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered and can’t for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays market maker naked shorting exceptions and legal practices of synthetic share creation new longs and shorts made from thin air relating to market making Below is a section of the SEC memo from page 8 that gets to the heart of it “Trader A may enter a buy write transaction consisting of selling deep in the money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale By doing so Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker dealer’s close out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion In practice however the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares and is instead re establishing or extending a fail position ” In short no pun intended these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that legally speaking they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located” Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares and Michael Burry’s now deleted tweet viewable here about how when he called back shares he lent out brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located To summarize it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand If this is true and there are signs that it is this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely This inspires a thought experiment if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a 500 to 5000 loss when prices were at 300 400 last week when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions The saying for stocks goes its only a loss when you sell The version for shorts would be its only a loss if you close out your short positions Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts here and here now a pastebin originally a popular post from a reddit user that present the argument that mathematically speaking shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions Based on this logic if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions In addition one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up Instead during this past week when shorts supposedly covered price of the stock somehow went into a free fall Why Something to think about I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March screenshot from a WSB post In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover What can retail investors do in that case Two thoughts come to mind A One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position If you care about forcing the issue you can follow the instructions here B Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation which you can do at Sidenote On the subject of synthetic long shares another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest calculations last week from a short interest from on 122 on 1/28 Thursday to 113 on 1/29 Friday to 55 on 1/31 Sunday which many found to be suspicious Later it was discovered that number of 55 was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113 short interest percentage but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the new short interest percentage of 55 and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior and if so to what degree is something to consider If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side For example hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real time short interest percentage A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves but while this report is a data point the data in the report will still be two weeks old With that said examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay retarded longer than funds can stay solvent The paper hand sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement To explore it from a different perspective if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient case in point being the retail sell off when the price started dropping At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze If you know your enemies and know yourself you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation calculated and continuous shorting short ladder attacks read this and this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares' which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts can be used to ladder attack the stock price which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play and other potential methods If his forces are united separate them aka divide and conquer Upon driving weak hands to sell off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some paper hands who then spread their views and further the divide Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division I will leave you with that and a reminder to do your own research for as investors we do not have all the information available and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion once brought to awareness would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further If you agree with the ideas explored in this post feel free to share with whomever

Explaing how we WON yesterday and how we have the potential to DESTROY all the hedge funds that shorted GME and change the ENTIRE Financial system forever disrupting the clearinghouses themselves!,20374,l7opbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7opbs/explaing_how_we_won_yesterday_and_how_we_have_the/,1348,1611942603.0,Explaing how we WON yesterday and how we have the potential to DESTROY all the hedge funds that shorted GME and change the ENTIRE Financial system forever disrupting the clearinghouses themselves I have to start his post that I am retarded and that this is not financial advice you all here do your own research and make your own decisions all I know is that I LIKE THE STOCK x200B 💎🙌🚀🚀 TLDR at the bottom 🚀🚀💎🙌 x200B I do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 9 58 AM and that we almost crashed the entire thing There was a post here describing a 30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb In this post they described and expressed their outrage with the Interactive Brokers Chairman interview THEY ARE CORRECT There was ANOTHER interview with Anthony Denier CEO of Webull that I did not see that received as much attention here In this interview it is a bit longer must watch imo It explains some of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with Vlad from Robinhood and what happened in general It confirms that 1 THEY HAD A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM 2 THE SHORTS ARE STARTING TO GO BUST 3 THE BROKERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO GET SHARES THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANT GET 4 THE BROKERS THEMSELVES CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS PROPERLY 5 THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO CANNOT COVER AND ARE GETTING LOANS FROM THE BANKS DUE TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS x200B Essentially we liked the stock so much 🚀🚀🚀 that the shorties all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron blew up so fast that the BROKERS could not properly margin call them in time THEY COULD NOT LIQUIDATE THEM IN TIME TO GET THEM TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS IN TIME Now the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot THIS is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening But we BLEW past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the 🌈🐻 now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you Since these brokers are large they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves As Thomas Peterffy flexes that he has billions to cover When I heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses Then it hit me THEY CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS These brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them The clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account They usually have about 1 2 of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction HOWEVER for GME it is raised to a 100 THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT SETTLE THESE TRANSACTIONS Once Robinhood's clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through Webull's clearing house I belive it is Apex that they use They almost IMMEDIATELY had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions THEY STARTED TAKING LOANS FROM BANKS TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HALTING THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTIONS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STOCK TO GO AROUND At this point what that all means is that THERE IS not enough stock to go around and the LOSES of these 🌈🐻 are so LARGE that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do And their CLEARING HOUSE cannot do it either THIS IS WHY THEY STOPPED YOU FROM BUYING BUT ALLOWED SELLING They used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHORT LADDER ATTACK The most beautiful thing happened EVERYONE HELD From Luis Rossmann's Video 6 18 Bid vs Ask price difference is massive Look at that difference between BID and ASK I love ALL of you You all 💎🙌 that shit so hard x200B You yes YOU reading this because you 💎🙌 that shit the price did not drop further Because of every single one of you they were not able to cover their positions x200B What this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy 🌈🐻 hedge fund 🌈🐻 managers but also THE BROKERS THE CLEARING HOUSES and the WHOLE THING x200B Now this all means that we are very very VERY close to winning At this point IF we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today it will be 15million 20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause the SQUEEZE to the moon 🚀 x200B At this point I plan to hold and you should too If we keep drying out these clearing houses brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely The more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution x200B x200B TLDR The brokers have let their 🌈🐻 clients🌈🐻 lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares The losses are so large that THEY the BROKER are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SHARES because of the capital requirements for GME and they are borrowing from the banks This is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market Buy them out and then buy on brokers like Fidelity that do not have a clearing house This is why they stopped allowing GME to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses Everyone here managed to 💎🙌 so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the BID/ASK price to increase drastically I am buying and holding 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀GME to the moon 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀 I have 15 shares $40 44 not much I know but I am gonna reload asap and I am planning to sell 10 20 at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $42 069 69/share x200B EDIT I should have made it more clear for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like Fidelity ,2021-01-29 19:50:03,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,
Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,12041,lglrg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1345,1612959657.0,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together TLDR Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME and if true was likely aided by DTCC whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226 and later in the range of 150 percent of total float Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example Where do these shares come from One potential explanation is synthetic long shares created via a loophole described here or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting I’m an entrepreneur not a finance expert so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject I started with this “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver For example human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book entry form thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three day settlement period A fail may also result from “naked” short selling ” Interesting We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox “Abusive naked short sales can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price to the detriment of all of its investors The Commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three day settlement period is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws … We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities Specifically these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership voting lending and dividends from issuers Moreover they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price Source In a different speech Mr Cox re iterated that short selling helps prevent irrational exuberance and bubbles But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it ” Mr Cox also “referred to the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “ a tool to drive down a company's stock price and that the SEC is concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO which reminds me of this piece I wrote source for SEC Chairman’s words As another datapoint Robert J Shapiro former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1 000 companies into the ground Source This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008 I also read ‘ One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books This has been alleged to create phantom or counterfeit shares sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares and artificially depressing the share price’ ” Shortly after I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers Taibbi said that the two firms got a push into extinction from a flat out counterfeiting scheme called naked short selling Source All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen potentially even an infinite short squeeze On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre trading started the stock shot up to 513 in pre trading and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling followed by several other brokers Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying but funds were not When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2 5 billion to Melvin Capital one of the short side funds and is also responsible for something like 40 of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself Now personally speaking its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this However looking into the details of what happened a skeptical part of me became suspicious Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening On that day there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag Worse DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts From an article dating back to 2007 “Depository Trust Clearing Corp is a little known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers About 99 of the time trades are completed without incident But about 1 of the shares valued at about $2 5 billion on a given a day aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days for one reason or another These failures to deliver have put DTCC in the middle of a long running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices ” Source Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time According to Wall Street Journal “ There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens The fight is over how prevalent the problem is and the extent to which DTCC is responsible Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern ” Source It has been alleged in tens or hundreds of lawsuit s that the DTCC and its Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds Law suits have been brought against Merrell Lynch Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley JP Morgan UBS other market makers and also the DTCC The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases The information that they do release is incomplete self serving and misleading Source As a thought experiment lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME many many indicators point to this and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces Something to consider Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day From the Wall Street Journal “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice The latest move came last month when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale But some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough … Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months Until that failure is resolved there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account critics say This phantom stock can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked shorting problem ” source From everything I’ve seen as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26 many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented I personally hold the following hypothesis GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221 and 150 at various times and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122 GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering which is illegal to cover using this particular method and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed With the hearing coming up on February 18th I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing as well as your own district representatives and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing l They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares failed to deliver their complicity in naked shorting and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28 Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing Alexandria Ocasio Cortez email us ocasiocortez com mailto us ocasiocortez com Al Green email al green mail house gov mailto al green mail house gov Maxine Waters email maxine waters mail house gov mailto maxine waters mail house gov Nancy Pelosi Email email sf nancy mail house gov mailto sf nancy mail house gov And you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to Edit Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss Even if you've read it before recommend reading it again Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true Prime brokers are likely complicit Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC This brings up another interesting thought experiment On 1/28 when the price was 450 and shorts were likely under 100 if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME then when the squeeze was about to happen or happening if brokers margin called the shorts they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag By that logic they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think mostly likely happened Edit 2 A compelling theory put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs recommend giving it a read Edit 3 If you want to read more in depth about counterfeiting stock this is a good place to start ,2021-02-10

dictate the course of the entire market I did some research analysis Before I start I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism Hypothesis GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market New York Stock Exchange NYA Market Cap $22 9 trillion 2400 stock listings Nasdaq IXIC Market Cap 3300 listings S P 500 MC $31 61 trillion Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA Market Cap $8 33 trillion 30 largest of NYA and Nasdaq TLDR /Abstract I compare the relationship between GME and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship As GME rises the market responds by dropping Based on this data my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market If this data is accurate then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just GME indicators but also prospective market strategies/positions In short when GME goes up the market goes down TLDR for data I found that the NYA DJIA and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME NYA NYA p 0027 DJIA p 0018 Nasdaq p 0 88 START I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result However whenever I mentioned this idea I’ve been met with opposition so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above x200B GME DJIA IXIC NYA YTD DATA If you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price Meaning while the whole market collapses GME rises The opposite is also true as GME drops the rest of the market rises The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested PROCESS I calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME NYA DJIA IXIC All data can be found there x200B Covariance Correlation Matrices P values Statistically significant values highlighted The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA For those that are not into statistics the p value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance” It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance Any p value less than 05 is considered statistically significant A p value less than 05 basically says that there is less than a 5 chance that the relationships are due to “luck” As you can see there is a 27 chance that the NYA dropping is random and a 18 chance for the DJIA While the IXIC does not fit the bill I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC or when comparing DJIA to IXIC So what does this mean My opinions To me this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber rich but rather a battle for the entire market On January 26 the DJIA dropped 600 points the IXIC 300 points and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars At this point you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top 10 own 88 of the ENTIRE market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted it's theirs My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market Final thoughts/ Disclaimers Anyway this is just something I wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything None of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it I would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there I also want to clarify that this was based on limited YTD data I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff If anyone has access to quality data I would love to sink my teeth into it I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR Edit Wow I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community Thank you all so much I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality Correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable In a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the P test The P test essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between 2 variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck If you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant For instance vitamin b 12 claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no In layman's terms the p test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided there is a 27 chance that the two are UNRELATED or a 99 73 chance they are related In the scientific community anything below 5 or less than 05 is considered statistically significant Also I didn't just test correlation I also tested covariance Covariance is not the same as correlation Covariance measures the direction of the relationship In this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship Meaning when one goes up the other one goes down So with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship Apart from that it does not say why or how they related That is purely speculation and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data I am not convincing you to buy into mine Lastly I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of 500 dollars per data set Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it Other than that Thank you all so much for the support and awards Edit 2 The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility u/big boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA He got a correlation coefficient of 0 53 which is close to mine of 0 49 u /big boolean Graph For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post post your results and I will add them on For reference I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations Edit 3 I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in depth understanding of applied statistics than I do To all of you experts I welcome your criticism Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better Pointing out problems/faults is important but providing actionable solutions even more so ,2021-02-27

"The real DD on SLV, the worlds biggest short squeeze is possible and we can make history",5093,l6novm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/,1323,1611836076.0,The real DD on SLV the worlds biggest short squeeze is possible and we can make history Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV a follow up from my shorter post a few hours ago First things first don't do this until the GME rise is done Lets conquer one market at a time I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after Then again each person is an individual and that needs to be made clear as well If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end I present 2 investment DDs in this post the short squeeze and the fundamentals If you want to see what to buy The short squeeze Buy SLV shares and call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100 1 and 500 1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver but lets call it 250 1 for now This means that for every 250 ounces in open interest in the futures market only 1 actually gets delivered Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade its JP Morgan Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much but this simply isn't the case here The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world Real commodities are being traded and if you are short you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it If you remember oil going negative back in May that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value but there is very little physical silver actually readily available think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery with very little available to actually buy They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule The fundamentals The current gold to silver ratio is 73 1 Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver Naturally occurring silver is only 18 75 times as common as gold so this ratio of 73 1 is quite high Until the early 20th century silver prices were pegged at a 15 1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then In terms of current production the ratio is even lower at 8 1 Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years but now their silver vaults are empty At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0 24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil This 0 24 billion ounces represents only 8 of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally This means that 92 of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house Also with silver at $23 an ounce currently this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used as I have mentioned $70 billion sounds like a lot but we don’t have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot If the squeeze happens it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust but it is spread very thin Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper This means that even as the silver price skyrockets it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced Even if new mines were to be constructed it could take years to come online Finally most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment It is used in electronics solar panels and jewelry for the most part This demand wont go away if the silver price rises so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in driving demand for silver The $1 9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself x200B What to buy I will be putting 50 directly into SLV shares and 50 into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16 This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35 Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if we pull this off Alternate options buying physical silver this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay going long futures for February or March if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem We need actual physical delivery which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery miners I don’t recommend buying miners as part of this trade Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market Furthermore most silver miners only derive 30 50 of their revenue from silver anyways so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage Details on SLV physical settlement When SLV issues shares the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily From the SLV prospectus An investment in Shares is Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust The Trustee’s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1 100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form The bulk of the Trust’s silver holdings is represented by physical silver identified on the Custodian’s or if applicable sub custodian's books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future Join me brothers Lets take silver to the moon and take on the biggest and baddest manipulators in the world Please post rocket emojis in the comments as desired Disclaimer do your own research make your own decisions everything here is a guess and hypothetical and nothing is guaranteed not a financial advisor I have ADHD and maybe other things too Bear case silver does tend to sell off if the broader market plunges so it’s not immune to broad market sell off It’s also the most manipulated market in the world so we are facing some tough competition on the short side,2021-01-28 14:14:36,"SLV:Rise,GME:Rise",1,,,,,,,1,,

GME - It's all coming together,22166,mqd3o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqd3o5/gme_its_all_coming_together/,1316,1618381487.0,GME It's all coming together Apes I come to you as a fellow primate with excellent news my wife finally left me Now I have her boyfriend all to myself Before I reading I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences so please don't comment that these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research so do not take them as fact This is not financial advice I am not a financial advisor There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future The news Amazon Chewey Execs being appointed RC being named god of the board GME announcing the search for new C E O GME paying off senior notes today The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3 5M shares or $1B in value this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting 6/9 lmao Why it matters The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares When GME made this announcement the stock was at $190 GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens the market would react negatively to the stock and because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting that negative reaction could've been huge Despite knowing this they decided not to sell at that moment I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190 they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so With that being said I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190 If this wasn't their plan then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock which it did Finally when almost every analyst boomers says that GME is grossly overvalued it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher Therefore I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock To add to this GME has repeatedly warned in their S E C filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze they have said this twice since the original squeeze This to me seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought again just a theory Catalyst But what could the next announcement be It's very difficult to actually know The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C E O position or the digital transformation GME could very well announce Cohen as the C E O which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e commerce Again this is simply conjecture but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price However the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall First I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares only individual investors can do that If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears oh wait If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall that could be the ultimate catalyst for us Or if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares see my previous DD on that Personally I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon but I guess not Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep Timing The timing on the possible above mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect First our lord and savior Mr Gill's calls expire this Friday At the same time GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume pictured below The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways As many of you know the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap time for some chaos Finally we have the 4/20 lmao deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because as I said previously they have a vested interest in getting this above $190 Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch x200B Finally I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY which seems to be true but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad but GME moves when the market is volatile which usually happens when the market is bad And oh would you look at that SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 pre pandemic levels Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility For more on this I encourage you to read the everything short post which provides a much more in depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that Here are the charts The first one is VIX and the second is SPY both are the purple lines as you can see the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions As stated previously the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change The thing to get from this is that based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low Quick Note on Short interest Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19 50 which is still extremely high Most apes say that it's over 100 at minimum I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting naked shorting and synthetic longs see other posts for more on this Therefore I believe that the true short interest is over 100 It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2 with short interest being able 20 and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today Also based purely on logic it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50 Therefore I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious Conclusion So we have technicals lining up very nicely a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now a plethora of potential catalysts a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled abusive shorting a failure to deliver cycle an insanely volatile stock that loves good news a market that is thirsty for some volatility and oh year one more thing some damn primates that refuse to sell Stay strong apes ,2021-04-14 09:24:47,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

the GME chart looks like this Shitadel Max Pain Theory x200B Image is copied from one of u /chayse1984's posts Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason and it's not all Brownian Motion you stochastic cucks So we got two big fucking triangles up here but do you even know why Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday dipshits Okay let me tell you a story It's 2002 Young high flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck you money wasn't enough for him So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a Market Maker This was the start of Shitadel Securities the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet Almost immediately following its conception Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket Around this time MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time And boy does Shitadel an options MM nonetheless have an appetite for risk Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an Investment Bank the king of Chicago But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry Devastated For the first time in Kenny's padded cushiony life he faces what still isn't real hardship Too uncool for the club it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities aha get it on retail investors Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with Payment for Order Flow a practice pioneered by none other than Bernie Madoff E Trade TD Ameritrade Charles Schwab Ally Invest First Trade TradeStation Interactive Brokers Lite and yes Robinhood all contract with Shitadel for PFOF It's with a heavy heart that I tell you even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest internalizer in finance Oh for fucks sakes what the hell is an internalizer now At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us right In PFOF your order is sent from whatever discount brokerage you're using to Shitadel Securities who decides to either A pass your order onto the open market where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B to take the other side of your order short whatever you long or long whatever you short at which point the life of your order ends never making it to the open market You heard me right When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood your order may never land on the open market But this is fine right Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security the stock price on the open market wouldn't move there would be no volume on the open market and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing and massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position Okay but in order for Shitadel to do this they would need to be a monopoly right From https / / Okay but if Shitadel were to do this their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange and drive the price up before Shitadel right An obvious short attack https / /markets businessinsider com /news /stocks /gamestop stock price trading halts

$GME: How the Dip today was due to ETF shares being lent out (Over 3.5Million) DD,18549,m5zoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/,1229,1615893177.0,$GME How the Dip today was due to ETF shares being lent out Over 3 5Million DD Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2 month old dog Also due to wsb guidelines i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap Please bear with me not the 🐻🌈 Anyone questions Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10 15 working days jk Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly Exchange Traded Funds ETF An exchange traded fund ETF is a type of security that tracks an index sector commodity or another asset but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds Short Selling Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own but have instead borrowed likely from a brokerage Most people short sell shares for two reasons 1 They expect the share price to decline Short sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit 2 They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security For example if you have sold a put option an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security Authorized Participants An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund ETF They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market authorized participants create more Likewise as ETF borrow costs increase APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position and more likely to fail to deliver In a typical transaction the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102 to 105 of the shares' value in cash government securities or a bank letter of credit If the ETF needs to sell the stock it can recall it from the borrower But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF $GME relationship Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors x200B Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze x200B By law a fund can have no more than one third of its total assets in securities on loan Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF and redeeming others and getting the underlying securities in return so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates Because the supply isn't fixed there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short industry participants say The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending Suspicious isn't it Credit to u/hkzor for providing these images x200B x200B ETF 1 6 5M available last week to 4M today x200B x200B ETF 2 1 3M available last week to 850k today x200B x200B ETF 3 900k last week to 500k today Just taking into account Three ETF lendings you could see 3 35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure coupling it with High Frequency Machines being used the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before When coupled with synthetic longs via options gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be and provides the ability to naked short GME again This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index The Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25 of US equity trading volume therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated Failure To Deliver A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner x200B The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past x200B ETF's being shorted in the past x200B Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted Point being The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option Operational Shorting When faced with excessive buying pressure as we have witnessed with $GME Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as Naked and then locate or create the shares at a later time up to T 6 for bona fide market making However delaying past T 3 results in a failure to deliver but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T 3 because they are making markets and have an additional three days to settle trades a total of T 6 This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay I won't go too in depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's However I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread TLDR Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that Over 3 5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card Does it solve the issue No It only delays it and makes it worse Secondly there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price Can't stop won't stop Gamestop 🙌💎 As always Lambos or Instant Noodles🚀🚗,2021-03-16 13:12:57,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results.,5278,oawsxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/,1205,1625086722.0,I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right Here are the results Preamble Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489 return for his investors between Nov’00 and Jun’08 SP500 returned just 3 in the same period But I recently observed that in every news article/tweet he always talks about an impending crash As recently as last week he issued another warning stating that there would a “mother of all crashes soon due to the meme stock and currency rally that will approach the size of countries” Basically what I wanted to analyze was Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time Analysis The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News 1 I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the a Next 1 Month b Next 1 Quarter c Till Date I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous Also there are no news reports covering Burry before that The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction If Burry specifies a stock then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark If its broader prediction relating to the overall market then the benchmark used is S P 500 Results There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis came in May 2017 where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3 In his exact words I didn’t go out looking for this I just did the math Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse But it’s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine S P500 has returned a respectable 93 to date and there is no imminent threat of a World War happening Burry’s next prediction was in Sep 2019 where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago He said the flows will reverse at some point and “it will be ugly” when they do This prediction also did not pan out as S P500 has returned 50 to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid 19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery Burry’s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla’s stock price is ridiculous and that it would collapse like the housing stock bubble I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don’t know exactly when he shorted the stock The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec’20 when compared to Jan’21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December He reiterated again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11 to date over the last 4 months Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called coin a speculative bubble in March’21 coin has since dropped 28 in around 3 months Even in this case we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the greatest speculative bubble of all time Only time will tell how this one will turn out Conclusion I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became extremely successful But as you can see from the above analysis he is more often wrong than right with his predictions 2 But the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately 3 Out of the 100 predictions you make even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry you will have to follow all of his recommendations 4 and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario Footnotes 1 Google News has a nifty feature where they allow you to search news in specific time periods Also Google News seems to capture almost all the major publications other than the historical archives 2 The current analysis is done using all the publicly available records We are not considering the personal bets he made conversations he had with his friends/family/investors etc This can definitely alter the 3 Take the classic example of Keith Gill aka DFV He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM This phenomenon is known as black swan farming 4 At that point if you are that confident in his predictions you can invest in his hedge fund Please note that you need to have a minimum capital requirement $1 million minimum investment and some extra regulatory requirements Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor ,2021-06-30 23:58:42,NULL:NULL,,,,,,,,,,

going to the moon REASSURANCE DD I've spent the past 5 fucking hours researching this shit and stumbled across some absolutely GAME CHANGING information that everyone should know about This is a long read but bare with me this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by or for the account of the seller Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale however the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three day settlement period As a result the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high This is what happened today with the price decrease Source Section II Background IMPORTANCE OF FAIL TO DELIVER The SEC

can only be higher now Regardless the sentiment stands shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward What's to be done Rule 204 Rule 204 — Close out Requirements Under Rule 204 participants of a registered clearing agency as defined in section 3 a 24 of the Exchange Act must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date referred to as T 4 if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date referred to as T 6 In addition Rule 203 b 3 of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days Threshold securities as defined by Rule 203 c 6 are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver You can read more about this here lots of information that I haven't covered Gamestop is or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail To Deliver's they've accumulated this month this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time frame stated above AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN Edit According to this website Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD TL DR The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win In a matter of days short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail to Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket

HAS I don't normally play meme stocks but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently GME TA The setup is a symmetrical triangle Normally when continuation patterns come from downside they have a bearish bias However we broke that red trendline with an uptick in volume this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months Not only that but TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD Confluence between technicals generate the best signals This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10 Price target for this is 231 52 resistance initially followed by 348 50 Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158 11 And that's it I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns trendlines volume Keep it simple You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up TL DR GME actually looks good for once from an unbiased technical standpoint EDIT Clarification I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158 11 I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid It could always form a new one I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point Edit 2 Not Financial Advice i thought that was a given Edit 3 It's back testing so far really common in Technical Analysis Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out which happens Edit 4 Backtested and bouncing so far Really important to reclaim 174 26 on the hourly close You can see we bounced off this zone from 168 07 167 55 that's key demand or support Edit 5 Reclaimed 174 26 back tested that as well Key levels are normally retraced as we move Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support Now 174 26 must hold as support and we are looking pretty good Edit 6 Bull flagging now into lunch time New support put up at 176 48 Constructive Edit 7 Great breakout from that flag New support put up at 181 50 Still need the 1 45 close for confirmation Look at the volume on that candle shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives Edit 8 Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open quit trading you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl Self proclaimed geniuses saying TA Doesn't Work On GME Ban it's not that TA doesn't work on GME The issue is all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before I don't blame you for feeling that way though so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it doesn't mean you should dismiss it The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly insane how sentiment shifted You guys are getting played like a fiddle The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat Lastly I appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn DMs are open Edit 9 189 00 is the next resistance coming up careful there Like I said 181 50 is the new support to hold Still on track for my price targets Volume is in all the right spots Edit 10 Backtested we are moving again Support is actually a zone from 182 51 181 50 Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two Remember some resistance at 189 00 might flag there the rest of the day Edit 11 3 13 P M 5/18/2021 Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume Still bullish consolidation below this key 189 00 resistance Above there straight to 200 Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near term trend Edit 12 3 46 P M 5/18/2021 They got the close just below the uptrend Not a great sign but only a 15m trend so not too damning We need to hold 182 51 181 50 They are going to try and test that now Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down Edit 12 4 01 P M 5/18/2021 Not an awful close but definitely not a great one Shorts fought hard end of day the fuckers They know if we break 189 they are done for Important thing though breakout is still intact Also broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help Tomorrow will be looking for 173 02 and 167 57 to hold and looking for 182 54 to break as well as 189 00 Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this Appreciate all the awards Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out Will probably move quicker since it’s GME Edit 13 9 35 A M 5/19/2021 Again getting dragged by the broader market Major indexes opened 2 Still holding up relatively well honestly Basically between 182 54 167 57 is CHOP It's when we break one of those that we can see the next move play out Remember I said this is a swing on these kinds of trades I just focus on the daily chart and sometimes the hourly for monitoring the health of the trends Major point is Above 167 57 and that teal line the breakout is still intact Edit 14 4 00 P M 5/19/2021 What a close Actually really interesting price action today We were able to defend all those levels Not only that but we fully backtested the pattern to the tick Breakout is fully intact still so long as we are above this teal line Just sitting in limbo waiting for volume to come in Technicals often precede news so we could see a catalyst soon 1h chart 1D chart Notice the volume was garbage today too So far a textbook backtest Levels for tomorrow 168 00 163 00 support 172 60 183 11 189 00 resistance Edit 15 5/20/2021 Just another low volume sideways day Everything important is still intact You can see we backtested and defended that support this morning We also made an attempt at clearing 172 60 but never got an hourly close Looking at the same levels tomorrow Really no surprise we went sideways the rest of the week since it's OPEX Important to ignore the chop and focus on where we are in the chart Holding tomorrow's close will be especially important since it's the weekly candle Top of the triangle will be around 161 00 tomorrow Levels tomorrow 167 53 166 63 zone 164 06 161 00 support 172 60 183 11 189 00 resistance We are also forming a wedge on the 15m chart Edit 16 5/21/2021 Broke up that wedge I mentioned yesterday We are in a rising channel right now need to keep this intact So long as it is we will keep making higher lows the yellow lines OPEX week is finally over All that happened so far is we chopped sideways above the breakout point This is bullish generally Remember I said it's likely we are waiting on a catalyst of some kind technicals often foreshadow this Next week we need to make our move They key is 182 56 above here and we should be off to the 230s Key resistance For support we are looking at that yellow line the lower one it will

Wondering where to set your sell limit for GME? Worried about missing the squeeze?

$GME Endgame - Game Theory & Best Scenarios,4690,l8t3dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/,1033,1612062701.0,$GME Endgame Game Theory Best Scenarios For those confused why BUY and HOLD are the investors best strategy both to stick it to hedge funds and profit this post is to map this out HEDGEFUND RISK First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds According to S3 analytics HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far Other reports have come out that hedge funds have lost 15 20 of assets so far this year Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here Citadel was worth $33B on Jan 1st so I believe this to be close Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal we can assume they are all in this together This prevents a prisoners dilemma for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs say an individual worth $2B Now let's assume short amount is 100 of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics This means to calculate daily interest we take 50M shares in float according to Fin Viz 25 interest rate 25/365 07 /day Share Price $300 $300 07 50M $10 2M in interest/day At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum of shares needed they can keep this up for 21 years So that's their situation The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going x200B HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others You need shares and you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere How do you do this There are three tactics likely 1 Settlement Let's go back to our shares needed 50M and value of the hedge funds $80B Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500 $1000/share So how would you do this You first use your friends to convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K Retail investors might even have an organization like SEC say they are protecting us after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is fuckers This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it Edit As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares not just government intervention x200B 2A Test Pricing Low The first test they did was to see if they could scare us A ladder attack costs them nothing And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until 2 30pm I'll explain why later I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range x200B 2B Test Pricing High Another strategy is to find a price cliff Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits This is more risky and will be used cautiously However I can't state this enough we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell x200B 3 Work with GME to Issue Shares If they think buying is dying down a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors Still keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point x200B Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks This can't go tits up Wrong Retail Investors still have the power x200B RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY So now you are a smooth brained ape What can you do to stick it to the twats x200B 1 HOLD If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares This leads to a long drawn out fight or settlement But guess what at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short term gains become long term gains less taxes x200B 2 BUY How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon RIs had two days where buying was diminished fuck Robinhood and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes maybe thanks to a whale If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP This is the most important though the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a dip Price is now pre squeeze and post squeeze If they can do this the retail investor wins The post squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell hopefully VERY HIGH and all shares purchased post squeeze will make profit x200B 3 FIND WHALES Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers x200B 4 DO IT QUICKLY HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely x200B RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING WHAT TO EXPECT Now that we understand that what will winning look like Well we have two outcomes x200B 1 Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power The price will gamma squeeze then squeeze and then game is over Watch for massive market dips x200B 2 Retail Investors Own All The Shares While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be again hopefully VERY HIGH EDIT THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100 OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL x200B TL DR Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD A successful retail investor strategy eliminates the idea that there is a dip to create a buying wall There is only pre squeeze and post squeeze prices A buying wall supported by a swath of limited order buys by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over One well intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on x200B This is not financial advise Do your own DD ,2021-01-31

to buy GameStop All of it don't upvote this it's mostly to reference later To start I would like to be very clear I am in no way investing in the short squeeze and for what I am doing it does not matter whether or not it already squoze vs yOu aRe HeRE VolksWagon graph My goal is not to make money My goal is not to lose money I am not trying to send a message I do not care about your upvotes I will not be donating any proceeds to charity Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds My goal is to own GameStop As absolutely much of it as I possibly can while I am alive and on this planet Because of this I want GME shares price to go down Whether this occurs due to algo driven price suppression or organic selling off of shares The more the value drops the more shares I can afford to buy obligatory Not financial advice I like the stock I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this Here are the facts 1 Mark Cuban raised a very valid point If you are investing in a company the way we used to as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company then prices going down is a good thing Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion 2 GameStop is poised to d o m i n a t e the space within the gaming industry Looking to build Esports arenas Guess what gyms are going out of business left and right Cheap real estate Dedicated gaming streaming channel Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming would be no surprise I'm not talking about livestreams I'm talking about produced content Speaking of live Twitch Discord Already set up and instead of competing GameStop could literally just buy these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord or leave them as is just own the revenue streams There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub epicenter really for such a massively exploding industry an industry with zero sign of slowing down Ever Entertainment as an all things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly Interactive entertainment is just unrivaled 3 The man the legend the boyfriend to all of our wives DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr G just doubled his shares position He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up I didn't do the math and I'm not gonna but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100 of those profits into shares anywhere near the top Because of this he has negative downside risk GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead I'm in a much much smaller but similar boat I made $100K and kept 100 shares which I fully intend to take to my grave This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place 4 GameStop will never be forgotten This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes the world will always always remember G M E 5 I am just fine financially My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue This is not a YOLO play I can afford to lose the money I am putting in Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance See above where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist so there's no money anyway The Plan Buy as many shares as I can afford never expecting to see that money ever again Sell a few covered calls way in the future at or out of the money As they approach expiration roll them forward another year This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops or secure and yes limit upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value As long as these options do not get exercised I will still own the shares I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25 35 cash ROI every year see below somewhere As I earn more money externally buy more shares Again as many as I can afford Every Single Year Just constantly expand my position No matter what Forever Profit never Not ever sell a single share Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to you guessed it buy more shares Remember my goal here is to own shares not to make money Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares Currently at the money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 about a year out are effectively worth 35 40 of the value of the stock Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35 each year Yes there will be a decrease in IV in this case but using externally earned money I should be able to make up the difference First milestone overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume I will never beat his gains and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns but that is fine My goal is purely share count Second milestone overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ryan cohen gamestop shares and I'm not gonna Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life before I get old and die Third milestone Own run and manage GameStop Whatever that means Member of the board sure Bust in on meetings like Hey I own most of this place someone grab me a coffee and then yell about how I pay your salary as I'm being escorted out by security more likely But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt With this strategy cumulatively expanding my position by 35 YoY I should be able to turn a 1 000 share portfolio into a 8million share portfolio in 30 years This is just based on current prices options values and my current income It couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1 $0 50 or $0 25 per share At a certain point cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock I like this stock and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success The only disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan it's not even a strategy at this point would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised calling all my shares away from me increasing my net worth by 35 all at once Or if GME just does really well organically which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all but I'm trying to do something specific here SEC interns I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone I just like the damn stock Hedgies and MMs please crank up your algos to maximum Never stop doing what you're doing I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY Current 💎🙌 shareholders you are the only thing standing in my way and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme ass prices If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits I will thank you for it If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it maybe shoot for buying back in lower I'd appreciate that even more Yes I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually whatever Might be a little bit to get started as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better But hey I have 30 years to get this sorted out right Make fun of me as I lose money Ask me for advice as I make money Call me an idiot for the platforms I use Try to sell me access to your crappy web based indicator research tools None of it will matter Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable I suppose tl dr there is no tl dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates edit 1 current positions which will change as I enact my genius plan yes I will post the first official update soon edit 2 To clarify a few things for those who apparently can't sense where some choice satire/irony/sarcasm is within this post as well as those who straight up can't do math Anyone who didn't chuckle at least a little bit at Gwitch and Gamescord is for sure dead inside Yeah Twitch may be out of reach but check out the timelines of Twitter adding pics Instagram adding videos and Vine existing yes vine is dead but TikTok took over that vibe I guarantee you something will be the Next Twitter or the Next Instagram or the Next Tiktok It likely will not literally replace these things but it will provide the next thing users want that hasn't been addressed And it will grow too big to get back the audience these 3 giants will have lost Something similar could happen with gaming And if GameStop makes it or buys the small service outright before they get too big to be bought then the prophecy will have come true Sick burns everyone I have not laughed this hard reading comments here since I first discovered WSB I absolutely love you guys The adderall bits in particular are gold Yes I am at baseline as of writing this stuff my baseline is high as a my risk tolerance Apologies for the length and lack of formatting and emojis This was really just supposed to be for me to point at later when people are all Why exactly are you doing this on future posts As Blaise Pascal said I would have written a shorter letter but I did not have the time edit 3 Okay basic math time Yes I calculated this with what few crayons I had not eaten so y'all can relax and let me do the reeeeing for you If you have $100 and you make 10 return you then will have $110 If with that new amount $110 you following and you make another 10 return now you have $121 Now I know it seems like you should have $120 and some of you seem to think that in order to turn $100 into $121 that I would have to add $21 of my own money from somewhere else But this is the magic of how ROI woks and a little thing called cumulative returns Okay gonna keep this in dollars for a moment just so you guys can follow and I don't lose anyone though it seems many of you stopped reading at Gwitch anyway and those are probably the only people here who could follow this elaborate and complex algorithm Let's say you own $1 000 and you can make 35 returns each year for 30 years This would be calculated as $1 000 x 1 35 30 Type that into a calculator and you'll get over $8Million Trust me and trust your calculator This isn't magic It's investing Now if you own 1000 share of a company and you call sell call options on those shares for 35 of the value of said shares then it does not matter what the share price is as the price goes up so does the value of that call option as the price goes down surely you get it by now If you quickly reinvest that money into the same shares at the same price then you will have increased your holdings by 35 On a yearly basis assuming the stock value ends at or below your strike price by expiration and assuming the IV remains high enough to do it again the following year then you could just do it again once that all expires worthless Only now you can do it with 1300 shares 1400 if you go ahead and just buy 50 more At this rate you would theoretically end up with 8 million shares at the end of 30 years If you can secure 5 more shares cumulatively on a weekly basis without them ever getting called away from you would own over 323 million shares within 5 years tl dr for real real this time If the stock literally ends every week lower than the previous week and ends every year lower than the previous year forever and assuming the volatility remains high or that I can make up the difference via infusions of cash externally Then I'm gonna own all of GameStop somewhere between 5 and 30 years from now If the stock goes up consistently especially if it goes up significantly then

Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,7813,l8efqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8efqp/why_buying_amc_helps_save_a_beloved_american/,1013,1612012012.0,Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds As we all know AMC is the second most shorted stock in existence behind only GME of course However the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores which GME did in large numbers this past year In place of the underperforming stores GME is expanding furiously into e commerce With RC now at the helm strategically its future is bright AMC is in the exact opposite situation It operates theaters which it cannot close down without permanent serious consequences There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic There is no e commerce pivot It has theaters and that's it For a while now AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times The shorts almost won This is where we come in The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds It is a lifeline to the real world operations of AMC A few days back one of AMC's debt holders converted $600 million worth of debt into stock and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions It an SEC filing this morning AMC said it will be issuing around 44 4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction which will reduce its debt by $600 million Earlier this month AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity in this case 14 million shares plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan As part of its recently announced fundraising AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4 80 a share It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year Now a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts But that didn't happen The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone The shorts will not win anymore it's just a matter of how much they lose This movement is legitimately saving a real American company This is not patriotic jingoism AMC by the nature of its business employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate The vast majority of its screens are in the US with a solid representation in Europe as well Yeah the popcorn is overpriced but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy And the enemy Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time This is not financial advice I just love the stock and hate hedge funds ,2021-01-30 15:06:52,AMC:Rise,,,,,,,1,,,

have a quick run through of the mid February 13F's to see who has the big positions against GME Here is the list if anyone is interested it covers everyone with positions over $30m I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere but wanted to make sure as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself As always this is not financial advice x200B It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself you will win one and lose one if you do not know your enemies nor yourself you will be imperiled in every single battle x200B This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME Surprise it's all the same people guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story Thing is even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S P Small Cap ETF some of these guys have very big positions against Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations What you have got remember is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful If you can't be bothered to look at the information below the big bosses are Melvin Citadel and Susquehanna SIG I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna SIG might be the final boss Guess what Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel Edit Guess who also owns 4 225 900 of puts totalling $85 448 000 and 4 196 299 of calls totalling $84 849 000 in RKT you are right Susquehanna Big thanks to the u/ Dadri88 below for this Guess who else also has a big position in RKT yep just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel $59 770 000 in calls and $37 189 000 in puts If I had a really big hedge fund maybe I would put puts and calls on a company push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna x200B Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool The company employs Bill Chen a World Series of Poker star in its quantitative trading group x200B The idiots on TV might say we are turning the market into a casino however we as shareholders are up against a

Shares",18607,ledjwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/,1002,1612694795.0,How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th 22nd or 25th with GME's 69 75 Million Outstanding Shares EDIT This post is meant as a mathematical Middle School Algebra exercise regarding GME stock and shorts The title itself is meant to be the literal end as intended and describes how it would be impossible for all shorts estimated to be covered closed and completely done and finished with only using the available outstanding shares on the specific days stated Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA I have hopefully labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations and pointed out some general assumptions more shorts mean more gains sarcastically that do not always appear to be true in the given data These are just general findings so chill the fuck out x200B Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA Jan29th text file Feb 5th text file regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices I promise you the long read is worth it but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9 The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached Please help out if there are any huge oversights or wrong calculations in the comments below as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver or just shady as fuck Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME source Yahoo Finance Figure 1 No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know So as EVERYONE KNOWS shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased and with supply and demand we aim for the heavens Figure 2 Shorts and Short Exempts note y axis is in MILLIONS as reported by FINRA during regular business hours So let's do a quick sanity check Looking at Figure 2 we see that on Jan 13th over 40 MILLION shorts were executed So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th we should expect to see that the price increased which it did Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day Figure 3 Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day Figure 4 GME Price change relative to the opening price that day Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day Again we see that Jan 13th increased by over 50 that day So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed and the price change for the same day Figure 5 GME Price change relative to opening price and the total number of shorts both short and short exempts during Regular Business Hours via FINRA NOW WE GOT A PLOT Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day But what do we actually get from Figure 5 Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS but we don't see that across the board though Jan 13th Jan 22nd Jan 26th and Feb 5th all show gains in price and large number of shorts 22 days I tracked and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours but only 4 days have gains of 20 or greater and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50 Eye Raise Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet The screaming cries of wallstreetbets Hmmmmm ok well maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts The HYPE was/IS real over GME and the world took notice Let's see how the volume changed with it First just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours x200B Figure 6a Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME as reported by FINRA Alright what do we get out of this plot Well from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF compared to early January BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend General Assumption I'M MAKING Most of the actual Retail Investors didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd x200B Figure 6b Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b So ASSUMING the above let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney So what's with the crazy high volume before then Is it from the insiders the true chosen among us the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots NOPE Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on The big bois had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000 short shares maybe Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading After Hours Volume Figure 7 Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME I DO LOVE PLOTS Here I've taken the regular hours volume again from FINRA and subtracted it from the day's total volume as reported by Yahoo Finance to get the After Hours Volume But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd and has remained where MOST of the action is going on GENERALLY Retail Investors don't/CANT engage in after hours trading And also don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker dealers and big bois are doing at 2am We see around Jan 13th after hour volume went above 50million my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts and the few following days thereafter Hmmmm OK let's take a step back and look shorts again x200B Figure 8 Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume just during regular hours are shorts I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts if so PLEASE COMMENT IT And because I can't get after hours short volume we have to make a wild guess as to this next step So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get Figure 9 Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance NOTE Figure 9 is an estimate but it's still a low ball estimate ASSUMPTION Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75 of just shorts Still let's roll with Figure 9 Looking at Jan 13th we estimate the number of shorts executed was over 76 MILLION And there are 69 75M shares outstanding yep ok checks out x200B TLDR Go to Figure 9 NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE and a low one at that and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts ON THOSE DAYS see edit below x200B Not financial advice not advocating violence not legal advice just doing some math while my wife and her boyfriend watch The Crown Edit 1 Yes title is a typo Shorts WE ARE Covered smh Edit 2 finra link seems to break for some with the https // in the front try it without and added direct links to text files Also no I did not include ways to

The Apocryphal Twain I The Short Interest Numbers Short interest SI is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares See Apparently other firms have used different versions of float All other forms of float are likely incorrect and not likely used by Finra This is an important assumption if I am wrong here then fuck Edit to above People are suggesting my float is wrong That is exactly my point I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA post it this post is then useless The math working backwards from 226 is fair game however That's why it's possible I'm wrong see See also comment by JeanGuyRubberboots below ctrl f Either way it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock I want to see the actual float used by FINRA Until then here's the math based on the SI equation Total outstanding shares of GME is 69 75 million See Finra SI of GME is 78 as of January 27th See 78 69 75 million 54 405m Thus 54 045m million shares are short GME of January 27th To calculate real SI we remove insider ownership Another big assumption Insider ownership stands at 19 06m See Thus free float is outstanding shares less insider ownership shares 50 750 000 shares Real SI appears at minimum 1 07 54 405m/50 750m II The Shorts Remaining and Covered On January 15th GME SI stood at 121 See Thus from January 15th to the 27th we know at least 84 397m shares were shorted 1 21 outstanding shares By January 27th 54 405m shorts remained previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1 27 The number of shorts that covered from Jan 15th to the 27th was was 29 992m 29 992m/84 397m shares 35 Thus 65 of shorts pre squeeze remain owing APR Around 35 of covering resulted in a 1 600 rise Thus a 65 cover rate conservative can yield a 2 971 rise Let’s apply this math to now From $50 this is a $1 485 50 GME price result Could this happen No idea Notice the problem with this I'm assuming only covering led to this rise So this is simply a demonstrative point New shorts from Jan 27th to present likely opened at higher prices 65 of those from $5 $10 $20 etc probably remain This is bad news for HF's III The Effect Based on estimated remaining covers price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM This part is unclear We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze In my opinion it wasn't until drops below $200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts This is a substantial point if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought then the pain points for HF's are far lower It's just unclear Nonetheless HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions See You'd think these are correlated markets so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted Or because there is no volume on the stock I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions but I imagine they're higher I don't know more beyond this Feel free to debate Moreover consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME It appears that retail buying power is spent People either cashed out or are holding So they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze or a gamma one for that matter Thus the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional Not all hedge funds are short $GME nor are all financial whales In my view this has become an institutional fight with both sides pointing the gun at each other waiting who's going to pull the trigger first Retail is simply on the sidelines holding the clips in for both their guns smirking of course How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart they can't be fooled twice etc and all of that non sense But before intelligence comes greed And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system IV Parting Thoughts It would take a half brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers Yet Finra was late posted after hours I think This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers yet again dead silence from the mainstream media Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests Americans with $2 000 in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud that is the general public and the focus doesn’t appear to be on hedge funds and not the Big Money that loop hole engineered an illegal 140 naked short situation See see also The Big Short is illustrative It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions Put differently fraud doesn't just pervade the system nay it is the system Everything I've seen just doesn't feel right Understand at this point I'm speculating But I trust my gut There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME This is beyond my knowledge span However if you looked at the bid ask spreads this week of $GME they were at times pennies apart for days I've never seen that before Seriously what the fuck DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood Citadel and Melvin Capital Next Thursday is a day to watch for me Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America and arguably the globe Americans and the world will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50 90 For many their life savings No it wasn't a result of imprudent investments to invest money into a squeezing stock is a good idea short term It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money So when the risk of you getting that rich increased they stopped the game pun intended We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion that's just speculation and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is But think of how this plays out these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it Or they tell you the truth that based on risk management and capital models they never thought retail would get that rich that fast Either way I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television A key element to the public's reaction AOC grilling the hell out of these folks That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching And to set the record straight I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands middle America is holding because they have nothing to lose after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired In the process of stunting buying pressure they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders Poetic justice and fucking hilarious I'm not demonizing rich people We all want financial freedom I'm demonizing cheating the game However this ends one thing is clear The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie TLDR it's in the damn title Disclaimer because working people are vilified when the financial system is exposed does this sound familiar It should because it's a reoccurring pattern When rich people lose poor people are blamed and we foot the bill I'm a random guy on the internet stating my opinions so if you take my advice to do anything without your own research you are dumb This DD could be garbage If you disagree comment below and counter me I don't want an echo chamber Not a GME promotion just more DD To be accurate it doesn't appear small traders are being targeted But you get the idea ,2021-02-14 04:08:44,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

"Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, & Submersibility + My Lockup Plan",5966,lkngg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/,970,1613452762.0,Former PLTR Engineer DD Part 2 Usability Deployabilty Scalability Submersibility My Lockup Plan Honestly this DD requires a lot of critical thinking If that’s not your jam please enjoy this cartoon of Alex Karp crushing the competition then scroll down to the bottom of the DD where you’ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex Palantir designer u /gottacroe and my wife u /LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein Lots of words below so here’s the TL DRs Table of Contents a self dox and position disclosure before my DD TL DR 1 After watching Demo Day twice I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG MSFT and CRM Apollo is absolutely incredible and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines Lastly it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best of class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir Bottom line I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day You've come a long way baby TL DR 2 IBM just surrendered to PLTR In the words of POTUS this is a… Big Fucking Deal To put it politely IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp First they ignore you Then they laugh at you Then they fight you Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades TL DR 3 Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal Rio Tinto and PG E signing a new enterprise deals AT T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills and 2 500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world etc IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world If they’re in I’m in TL DR 4 Eventually institutional traders will comprehend the immense long term value of Planeteer Planter Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club Table of Contents 1 Praise Constructive Criticism for Demo Day 2 Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit 3 The True ROI of Palantir 4 Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines 5 Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments 6 Should you YOLO on PLTR 7 My Appreciation for the Palantir Team 8 Musings on Earnings and Unlocking Because there are so many shills pumpers and bullshiters on WSB these days I’ll self dox myself I’m Jason Payne I joined Palantir in early 2007 when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams and left in 2015 to become the CEO of Ada Diamonds hence my username I joined Reddit to do an official AMA on laboratory grown diamonds a few years ago that hit the front page stuck around and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community Thus I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD I’m not Turns out I have a DD writing fetish Don’t kink shame Here’s a couple of my prior DDs on De Beers Tiffany Co and the FTC Positions or ban At the current PLTR share price I hold a Keyser Söze position I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset But I’m not going to I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20 and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon to be unlocked 80 with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position regardless of earnings tomorrow Why I like the stock a lot 1 Praise Constructive Criticism for Demo Day Existentially Demo Day was incredibly impressive This thread with u/namingisreallyhard u/DentalFox and u/jamauer sums it up x200B Four things stood out to me Superior Design Language to CRM MSFT and GOOG Palantir has a completely different front end user experience UX than my time at Palantir that I saw for the first time on Demo Day I find it practical beautiful and efficient The design language is called Blueprint Javascript and it’s built on React a modern web development platform that Facebook built Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS meaning that anyone can use it Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data dense interfaces for desktop applications Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning the flat UX of Google and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded Getting that balance right is really difficult Deep Investment in Deployability Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software No one buys the backend system so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1 0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools Gmail Calendar AdWords etc The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40 75 faster than Salesforce Migration from ‘ Find the Terrorist ’ to ' Cheat Code for War ' When I was at Palantir the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war ’ and I think that is spot on That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics mission planning command and control etc military contracts recently including the Space Force DoD IL 6 SaaS Approval Palantir moving to IL 6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own but I’ll keep it short It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day I’d give the presenters a C at best I found it rushed confusing and difficult to follow I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content and I’ve given 500 Palantir demos in my lifetime My constructive criticism Slow down 15 20 Err on the side of a simpler more approachable lexicon For the love of God stop reading from scripts Use bullet points Handoffs were way to abrupt Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation · I don't know if it is just me but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way · It lacked charisma and charm and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students · I was watching the demo day presentation and left feeling underwhelmed It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry but from someone outside of it it all sounded greek to me · I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day if everyone told you that you ‘ killed it ’ you really need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power 2 Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me At Palantir we build Iron Man suits not robots No Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits AFAIK Palantir builds cerebral cyborgs not physical cyborgs Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve cerebral tasks not physical tasks x200B Iron Man Cerebral Edition If you have not watched Demo Day yet or you rewatch it listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers ’ Why a diamond fisted Iron Man suit Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents 3 The True ROI of Palantir Palantir is really expensive No question about it But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir Bad Decisions Being wrong is really really expensive See the Airbus 380 Microsoft’s market share of cell phones the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant shorting GME in early January and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization For example Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33 There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350 and the Foundry powered decisions led to a 33 improvement in production Palantir doesn’t make that claim Airbus makes that claim That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise x200B The BP renewal and the new deals PG E Rio Tinto Fiat etc prove u/petroduct is right If you have complex logistics you should have Foundry Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6 9 How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4 20 how much will their bottom line grow by 2025 Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations however if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved even a little bit the value to United is fucking deep The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry minor edits for brevity The return to service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity internal external to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover the models need to account for slow recoveries fast recoveries and everything in between Our optimization models consider when “big events” airframe checks engine overhauls and landing gear overhauls will be due along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them The models also incorporate other factors parts availability and cost available technician hours at each maintenance station ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers aircraft specific mechanical reliability and on time performance and even the quality of the in flight products seats Wi Fi entertainment power outlets The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program minimizes operating costs and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft the lowest cost aircraft or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event x200B 4 Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines Toward the end of the Apollo demo one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines IL 6 Clouds In Nuclear Submarines As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server x200B 5 Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture Booz BAE etc The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale In my mind the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument When I was at Palantir it was a bitch to build and manage deployments From what I saw on Demo Day Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce Lightning Apex SOQL and Visualforce Eventually Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP Salesforce Microsoft etc but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere Eventually Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments But in the meantime Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers FDEs will continue to directly manage deployments Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs I no longer worry about the scalability of that team Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG E ConEd and Entergy Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG E 1 year in ConEd and none in Entergy PG E improves decision making by 10 and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization ConEd improves decision making by 2 and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result They do not renew Assuming $500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal To put it another way when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years the FDE overhead is spooky But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long operating system for XXXXXX deals the FDE overhead is not significant Also to be honest there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is much less how to write code against it so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time 6 Should you YOLO on PLTR I’m not going to give anyone financial advice but I do want to point out a few things PLTR is not a meme stock Palantir is not a small cap that can move bigly because a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest most important organizations in the world Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued They may be right A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR CathThey may be right So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up down or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes Regardless of the ticker if you YOLO please YOLO responsibly my friends and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like a lot 7 My Appreciation for the Palantir Team I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades what you have built is incredible Thank you As an American thank you As a stockholder thank you Enjoy your tendies you’ve earned them my friends 8 How I Play My Lockup Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position regardless of a good bad or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG like is growth coming over the next 10 years Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years Also with the shares finally unlocked I can borrow against them for the first time I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre IPO so I’m not in any rush to sell My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of $100B with a ladder up to $250B So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5 of my remaining shares this week That’s my $0 02 on

Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon: Technical Analysis of Lordstown

Motors PART 1 Introduction Disclaimer This is not financial advice I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY why would you blindly listen to me Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors $RIDE It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out and I’m all for it I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling” coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real to be a credible source But enough metaphors Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance an electric full size pickup truck If any of you are like me you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon ” you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock So that’s what I intend to do I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of If you want some of that check out the post that was just made on the subject Instead using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings I will prove that not just I but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on oversold stocks like $RIDE that have all of the FUD priced in live and die by the motto “buy the fear sell the greed” I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way If you find yourself falling asleep at any point just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book PART 2 Technical Analysis Now as I already laid out I believe that $RIDE is undervalued however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone I prefer to trade on indicators Many people have told me I read tea leaves they call me John D Cuckefeller and if you feel the same then read no further But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with Volume and Short Interest Before we get into the technical analysis I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic short sales According to the numbers given to us by Fintel short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report and has largely fallen and consolidated since then Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally Not only are they scared of people like you who will target a stock just to hurt short sellers but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house Even given all this $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month to a total of 12 5 percent the total float And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent reveal of the endurance betas the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3 4 years away from production” like the bears claimed This is in my opinion very significant as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet Relative Strength For anyone who’s a fan of indicators it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up Just look at any relative strength oscillator many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics I won’t get too mathematical on you but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock Pretty simple $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company x200B The relative strength of $RIDE shown by Stochastics More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion MACD This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form Don’t overcomplicate this when the purple line is above the orange line the stock often goes up and when it’s below the orange line it goes down Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events In times of high volatility violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here GameStop x200B MACD analysis on GME Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time I noticed this crossover beginning to form and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing and the rest should be obvious A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150 the very next day I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more and in a time of great FUD I bought more Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu Or did is it just me Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real world example with GME just take a look for yourself with $RIDE x200B MACD analysis on $RIDE looking absolutely bullish AF A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀 This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago Historically the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center Similarly we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner I wonder what it was Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying When you see a MACD like this I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting Price Action PRICE ACTION The most important indicator of all It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around For the sake of simplicity I won’t go too far into this one Individual candlesticks are valuable but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment and more importantly the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so Specifically a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out but instead just look at the actions of real market participants Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things Positive divergence of the MACD and price action Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend and price is now consolidating before liftoff Instead of the smooth 1 day period chart we’re looking at a 4 hour period for more details Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up This is called positive divergence and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction which is a pretty big deal Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us As of just yesterday April 6th the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash a huge amount of upward pressure is building The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator this could result in a “ Bollinger Band Squeeze upwards very soon These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at and for $RIDE specifically the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30 $35 and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this PART 3 Catalysts and Fundamentals Since indicators are driven by price action which is itself driven by catalysts they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to As far as catalysts go Lordstown did just release their beta trucks last week News which I cannot stress enough I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET as discussed earlier They are also showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off road race in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 less than 10 days away Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse off competitors The current price just doesn’t make sense I also I like the design of the truck itself image is everything especially when compared to some of its competitors I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing Not to mention the Cybertruck Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially Yesterday the Camping World CEO tweeted a leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel through their partnership The electric RV market could be huge The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid for now PART 4 Conclusion Well I hope you learned a few things from this post even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here As I stated this is not my full time job I do this as a hobby Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired And for $RIDE specifically the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this Lest we all forget Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla have a good $RIDE everyone and don’t let the short bugs bite Positions 65 shares at 12 94 2x $20 07/16C 1x 15$ 01/21/22c EDIT Forgot to add but per page 21 of this slide deck the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6 2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2 01 billion An EV stock that is trading almost 50 below its asset value Come on now Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy TLDR I love $RIDE’s pretty charts and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore IMO $RIDE is poised for a breakout and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀,2021-04-08 06:40:34,RIDE:Rise,,,,,,,,,,

CLOV DD - No Bullshit,1895,mtkyw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtkyw2/clov_dd_no_bullshit/,938,1618807161.0,CLOV DD No Bullshit CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days To sum that up FactSet top financial data provider had the CLOV float listed as 23 5M and short interest at 39M putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146 6 This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday Factset has since updated the float to 109 8M making the 39M short interest account for 36 of the float They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares and although his shares are “non tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non tradeable unless converted so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with Now I could get more into the Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap like Factset updating the short float to 36 destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank BULLSHIT here’s why The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31 Over two weeks ago When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks With 30M short volume on 4/8 and 90M short volume on Friday according to Fintel We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest but given all this you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high For context 36 short float based on outdated short interest from 3/31 is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise end of story Now let’s get into the shit that really matters First off from a technical perspective there are some good signs if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section MACD bullish RSI only starting to warm up Decent support built between $7 $7 30 But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows Now let’s get into call volume Some of the order that came through Friday Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons 1 it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2 the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze x200B Next CLOV is down over 50 from Dec/Jan highs Some of the main reasons for the drop would be Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS Hindenberg short report Short seller price manipulation The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50 in the weeks following its release Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales as evidence stating that in 2016 “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ” Well just this month April 8th the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website see picture below The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency CMS they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states Which is huge news for CLOV by the way x200B Wrapping this up Now say what you will about Chamath but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze He promoted it posted his personal positions and while Wall Street CNBC and others attacked Gamestop Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target x200B No one knows what will happen in the market I sure as hell don’t but given all that's been laid out here I like the stock $CLOV to $100 x200B EDIT anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME it's not Holding GME love the setup going into this week Also this is not financial advice do your own DD blah blah blah And for those asking about my position I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance x200B Update 4/20 people asking if they should sell You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you Nothing has changed The market dumped and people sold If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control Long term my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy Dips are opportunities Not worried I like the stock Make your own decision ,2021-04-19 07:39:21,CLOV:Rise,,1,,,,,,,,

and Industry Tesla was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto California The company operates two segments automotive manufacturing and consumer solar energy The automotive manufacturing segment builds and sells automotive vehicles The consumer solar energy segment manufactures and sells solar energy generation to residential customers Tesla Financial Statements n d Tesla’s core business model across both segments relies heavily on state and federal government subsidies in order to operate “Tesla 10 Q” 2020 The company is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker TSLA Market Capitalization On February 3 2020 Tesla had a market capitalization of $136 9 billion On March 1 2021 Tesla had a market capitalization of $557 9 billion Tesla Financial Statements n d This represents a 307 52 increase in Tesla’s market capitalization between February 2020 and March 2021 At the time of this writing on April 9 Tesla had a market capitalization of $649 billion Tesla’s current market capitalization defies all rational explanations as it is being valued more than Ford General Motors Tata Motors Honda Motors Ferrari Lamborghini Aston Martin Mazda Nissan Porsche and Volkswagen all combined Tesla Financial Statements n d To assert that Tesla is more valuable than the worldwide automotive industry is a ridiculous proposition that is not substantiated by either business fundamentals nor future growth prospects Stock Price and Employee Information Tesla stock price also had parabolic movement as the stock price increased 360 53 between February 2020 and March 2021 On February 3 2020 Tesla closed at $153 00 By March 1 2021 Tesla closed at $718 43 Tesla Financial Statements n d As of December 31 2020 Tesla employed 70 757 employees This represents a 47 36 increase in employees when compared to December 31 2019 when Tesla had 48 016 employees Response to COVID 19 Tesla was affected by the Covid 19 epidemic that disrupted global trade in 2020 At the start of the pandemic Tesla received an undisclosed amount of government assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program “Tesla 10 Q” 2020 When California went into lockdown on March 18 2020 Tesla’s Fremont CA factory continued its operations Elon Musk was defiant in his insistence that Tesla’s operations not be disrupted even with the virus spreading throughout California Elon Musk v Public Health 2020 After public outcry Tesla shut down the California factory on March 23 2020 However by May 11 2020 Elon Musk resumed operations at the Fremont CA factory in defiance of the state law By May 13 2020 Alameda County CA withdrew their enforcement of the law and allowed Tesla to continue operations as long as they followed social distancing measures Elon Musk v Public Health 2020 It is unclear if there was any actual oversight or enforcement of those policies By November 2020 California had granted Tesla “essential workforce” exemption Kolodny 2020 While there are no consistently reported figures it is estimated that over 400 Tesla employees contracted SARS CoV 2 between May and December 2020 Boudette 2021 Analysis of COVID 19 Response Tesla’s source of value is derived from automotive sales of the Model 3 and the Model Y both of which are only manufactured in Fremont CA and Shanghai China Going into 2020 Tesla only had $8 2 billion in quick assets and $10 7 billion in quick liabilities Tesla Financial Statements n d With a quick ratio of 0 76 Tesla was in a vulnerable position when the COVID 19 pandemic started Shutting down the Fremont factory in accordance with state law would likely have been catastrophic to Tesla’s financial health as the company has often been in a precarious financial balance between solvency and insolvency Note Tesla has nearly gone bankrupt in 2008 2014 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 Elon has a gift for doing magic tricks and buying himself more time This uncertain situation is likely what drove Elon Musk to be so defiant about the company’s operations and eventually caused him to rebel against the state’s legal measures to shut down all but essential businesses of which Tesla is not This is also the likely motivation behind the stock dilution seen in Q3 and Q4 2020 when Tesla issued more stock and raised $12 686 billion Tesla Financial Statements n d A curious observation is found when looking at the cash flow from operating activities and comparing it to cash flow from financing activities Year over year Tesla is a company that consistently subsists itself through financing activity not operating activity Tesla Financial Statements n d When looking over all of the relevant information it is clear that Tesla did what it had to do in order to remain solvent However it is also clear that they were entirely fixated on staying operational at any cost even if it meant its own employees were put at risk of infection from SARS CoV 2 Employees should re evaluate their relationship with Tesla and decide if the company views them as an asset or an expendable resource Tesla’s efforts in this regard were found wanting SWOT Analysis Tesla’s strength is really down to the cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk For better or for worse without Elon Musk’s personal brand Tesla would have gone bankrupt long ago because it is not a sustainable business model Tesla has survived through a combination of a secular bull market dovish monetary policy generous fiscal policy corporate welfare and legions of wishful thinking investors Strauss Smith 2019 The weakness surrounding Tesla is that despite what seems to be carefully crafted earnings management the core business of Tesla is not profitable and may never be profitable A counter argument may be that other automotive manufacturers also have razor thin margins and not the best balance sheets This is a fair argument but it is important to point out that Ford Motors and General Motors have vastly higher revenues than Tesla and they rely on cash flow from operating activities not financing activities to stay solvent There are many threats that Tesla is facing Tesla has many eerie similarities to Enron NYSE ENE Enron executives were publicly hostile towards short sellers and Elon Musk is particularly vocal about his disdain for short sellers Niedermeyer 2019 Enron was routinely hailed as a futuristic innovative disruptor that was changing the world Note You can read more about this in Niedermeyer's book Also read more here here and here Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle EV than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers As such they will continue to take market share away from Tesla and may eventually take over the company MacDuffie 2018 While China has been seen as the promised land for Tesla's profitability China has many state sponsored investments into their own companies such as XPeng Kharpal 2021 and Nio Nio Motors Has n d From a geopolitical perspective it is unlikely that the Chinese government will allow a U S business to dominate their own EV market Note they absofuckingloutely will not allow this to happen The opportunity that Tesla really has is the new administration in Washington D C which has recently unveiled a bill entitled “The American Jobs Plan” American Jobs Plan 2021 which will invest up to $3 trillion over the next 15 years Much of this bill will involve infrastructure and clean energy initiatives This is something that Tesla will undoubtedly capitalize on and enjoy the juicy resources provided to them courtesy of the U S taxpayer Regardless of sentiment this fresh capital influx will likely stimulate the company’s operations and allow them to continue operations for the foreseeable future Recommendations and Predictions Using a valuation based on comparable firms Berk et al 2017 Tesla’s intrinsic value is much closer to $32 82/per share with a current book value of $24 03 Tesla Financial Statements n d With 959 854 000 shares outstanding this fair value would give Tesla a more realistic market capitalization of $31 5 billion Tesla Financial Statements n d This market capitalization would be comparable to other auto manufacturers like Ford and General Motors However this represents a 95 decrease in the current market price of Tesla This would still be a generous valuation for Tesla as at $32 82 per share because the PE ratio would be around 51 and still far higher than the industry average of around 24 To be even more generous one could give Tesla a valuation based upon the discounted free cash flow DFCF method Berk et al 2017 This would give Tesla a market capitalization of $312 9 billion and a valuation of $325 89 per share yet this is still 51 86 lower than where the market is currently pricing the stock at This DFCF valuation uses a discount rate of 11 and operates on the assumption that Tesla’s earnings will grow by 50 every single year through 2026 before leveling off at a 10 earnings growth rate from 2027 onward This simply is not practical as Tesla’s revenue growth has only been forecasted to grow at 33 every year through 2023 It is safe to say that Tesla has already been “priced to perfection” and then some While the story of Tesla has largely been a successful example of “fake it until you make it” reality will eventually catch up to Tesla whose brand is inseparable from the brand of Elon Musk Were this a street report the coverage would be initiated with a “Strong Sell” recommendation and a $33 00 price target In order for Tesla to justify its unreasonable valuation the company will need to demonstrate that it can achieve sustainable profitability without the extensive use of government welfare in the form of rebates and subsidies that are paid for by U S taxpayers To that end it needs to increase operating margin expansion and drive new revenue growth through licensing The licensing of its proprietary software and intellectual property to other automotive manufacturers might be its only saving grace in the years to come as more experienced auto manufacturers take market share from Tesla in the EV space References American Jobs Plan 2021 April 08 Retrieved April 10 2021 from Berk J DeMarzo P Harford J 2017 Fundamentals

ANALysis recently fractals and shit and found out that GeeMEeee is going to fking PENETRATE $1K next week Hope you enjoy the read Yeah you heard it right and you most likely know that already but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen The analysis is build upon fractal techniques so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast Buckle up and eat a Crayon fellow trader the word is used as anagram you know for what as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading and it might even help you with the digestion of the information in the post This is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis 1 Well that's a good question When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan JK leave poor Vlad alone for a moment The fractal from Latin fractus means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern formed by a sequence es of candles which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time frames Fractals are simple yet important repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend Apely speaking fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument Now that the captain is gone let's get to business GME fartcals wroom wroom I know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis Furthermore I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences using simple lines and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it What you see on the chart one candle represents 2 hours of price action above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse 14 16 Jan followed by another turquoise consolidation this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days Next is where the things really start to get interesting 22nd Jan as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially This accelerection does not go quietly erupting into a powerful gap not as big as the one in your head though Finally starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex pay attention to this peak as it will be used for calculations later on the 27th of January 'What Why purple rectangle ' you may ask Easy REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame That was only the left part of the chart Now let's be brief for a moment There were six main components to the fractal base turquoise consolidation magenta uptrend turquoise consolidation 2 magenta impulse gap and purple rectangle What you see on the right is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother Particularly starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests And this is how we really utilize fractals identify the fractal sequence from the previous data on the left and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions on the right Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph don't they Coincidence I think not Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON 1 Here you go boy Allrighty I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of Count to six yes you may use your fingers Twice Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies 1 flat line 2 small magenta hill 3 line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit 4 accelerection 5 your brain aka Gap 6 Valhala REKTangle / GME go BBBBRRRRRRR Good boy/girl you've come this far Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced you may get some rest Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend because we are DIVING DEEPER Ok it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row So I ate a pack this time and I am full of GMEnergy As is the chart below so bullish that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit but the apes have to evolve at one point in history so I really encourage you to use this opportunity In depth fractal forecast I hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title finally Ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable where did A B come from The first and most important notice is that A B fractals are built upon 1 2 3 4 5 6 and on the chart you can see that A measures 1 2 3 4 pattern while B covers 5 6 steps of the sequence A B on the left January run is self explanatory the fractals are measured as they are A B on the right current price action formation is where we need some math to get involved particularly when we are working with the new B movement prediction And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance Again the main fractal property re occurrence will play on our side Predicting the price movements on a volatile market like this one is one of the most ungrateful things to do so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you apesters My theory is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move using data from previous one And here we only need the coefficient from first A B move A simple ratio dividing first B move about $325 increase by first A move $131 gives us a coefficient of about 2 48 Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height about $330 based on my prediction which is built later in this post which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818 landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week Boom looks beautiful and promising Fractals baby I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far smoothie brainie But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed Particularly it is the the sequence part number 4 where the price action stands currently And yeah you guessed it almighty fractals are helping us here again Below you will find two charts both are 30 min charts which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why GME price action 22 27 January GME price action 5 15 March Because they look similar again Now I will ask you to excuse me I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago and I really need to get some sleep as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left so this explanation will be brief I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs Remember being in the market at those moments Wooh that was fun And finally take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow not only it averages the price action it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action $380 ish That's it folks mic drop TL DR Fractals is life fractals is love ❤️ as is GEEEMEEE,2021-03-15

All the tactics used in the recent week by hedge funds revealed and explained All the tactics Hedge funds are using to crash GME prices were revealed as far back as 2014 in this article Anatomy of a short attack TL DR Ladder attacks to drive the price down Media assults Brokers pulling margin Paid bashers Diversion attempts all tactics seen in recent weeks were predicted by this article from 2014 Transcript if website crashes due to traffic Anatomy Of A Short Attack Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses Potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized The attack is planned to its most minute detail The plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill gotten gain When it is time to drive the stock price down a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers The playbook is very similar from attack to attack and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well Typical tactics include the following Flooding the offer side of the board Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply offer and demand bid for the shares find equilibrium This equation happens every day for every stock traded On days when more people want to buy than want to sell the price goes up and conversely when shares offered for sale exceed the demand the price goes down The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares They will do what has been called a short down ladder It works as follows Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10 Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position Short B will then offer a short counterfeit share at $9 Short A will hit that offer or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid Short A buys the share for $9 covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral If there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic fails to deliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will mask the extraordinary high volume It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares An off shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access The trader's performance was tallied and based upon the number of shares moved and the other success parameters the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily At the end of each day the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe Instant gratification Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry By early 2005 their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent At that point an investor Robert Simpson purchased 100 of Global Links' 1 158 064 issued and outstanding shares He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC disclosing he owned all of the company's stock His total investment was $5205 The share price was $ 00434 The day after he acquired all of the company's shares the volume on the over the counter market was 37 million shares The following day saw 22 million shares change hands all without Simpson trading a single share It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation but that would be difficult without the company's involvement It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume This is called crashing the stock and a successful crash is a one day drop of twenty percent or a thirty five percent drop in a week In order to make the crash stick or make it more effective it is done concurrently with all or most of the following Media Assault The shorts in order to realize their profit must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media The shorts have friendly reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency the Wall Street Journal Barrons the New York Times Gannett Publications USA Today and the Arizona Republic CNBC and others The common thread A number of the friendly reporters worked for The Street com an Internet advisory service that short hedge fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted libelous innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company as it was being crashed One of the more outrageous stories was a front page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005 The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times This mistake was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story The explanation Due to a mathematical error appeared three days later after the damage was done to the stock price Jim Cramer in a video taped interview with The Street com best described the media function When shorting The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view so the hedge funds create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders a short down ladder that pushes the price down then we go to the press You have a vicious cycle down it's a pretty good game This interview which is more like a confession was never supposed to get on the air however it somehow ended up on YouTube Cramer and The Street com have made repeated efforts with some success to get it taken off of YouTube Pulling margin from long customers The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy This causes a flood of margin selling which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover Paid bashers The shorts will hire paid bashers who invade the message boards of the company The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics Analyst Reports Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports The reports which were represented as being independent were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned friendly media All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation Planting moles in target companies The shorts plant moles inside target companies The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors They steal confidential information which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media The information may not be true may be out of context or the stolen documents may be altered Things that are supposed to be confidential like SEC preliminary inquiries end up as front page news with the short friendly media Frivolous SEC investigations The shorts leak tips to the SEC about corporate malfeasance by the target company The SEC which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests swoops in as the supposed confidential inquiry is leaked to the short media The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings Occasionally they do uncover an Enron but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty five percent The announcement of no or little findings comes months later but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community Class Action lawsuits Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes a handful of law firms immediately file class action shareholder suits Milberg Weiss before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation could be counted on to file a class action suit against a company that was under short attack Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media again causing panic among small investors Interfering with target company's customers financings etc If the shorts became aware of clients customers or financings that the target company was working on they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product Disclaimer This is not financial advice this is not my work I'm just copy/pasting the article bolding the most

This is going to be the first post of 5 regarding crispr and why it's the play of the decade 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Mods thank you so much for letting me post it If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any edits no pun intended The next post will be about their current drug pipeline This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10 k's licensing agreements court filings and a lot of adderall Intro What is crispr Crispr stands for c lustered r egularly i nterspaced s hort p alindromic r epeats It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes Why should I care Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century and received a Nobel for its discovery last year It's not an understatement that in the next coming years crispr will impact just about every part of our lives It's not just me saying this Bill Gates poured in $100M and momma Cathie believe that this is one of the most revolutionary things of this century Joe Davis of Vanguard found the idea multiplier to be similar to how the internet took off If you cannot see this can change the world crispr could help by eliminating that extra chromosome you probably have Editas $EDIT Editas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders in vivo and for various forms of cancer ex vivo Their business model is actually pretty smart They're targeting rare diseases for drug development and licensing out the IP for crispr Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable and easier to develop You essentially can monopolize a disease and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up The IP though is going to be the breadwinner Essentially any drug developed with crispr will give an 8 13 royalty to $EDIT Not to get too technical but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary and far exceeds anything else on the market They estimate they can target about 95 of the human genome One drug of note in their pipeline that is of interest is EDIT 201 EDIT 201 is essentially engineered T cells with CARs and Engineered TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells This is an interesting treatment solid forms of cancer This could potentially be an alternative or complementary to chemotherapy The collaboration is with Juno Therapeutics acquired by BMY who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources Others include sickle cell usher syndrome and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials The patent $EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement But there is a consensus slowly forming that $EDIT will acquire the patent The winner for the patent will easily make billions off of the IP If Broad wins the patent it is the responsibility of EDIT to develop drugs based off of crispr and license the patent to other companies which $EDIT would collect a royalty of $EDIT is then set to pay a royalty from that revenue to the Broad Institute $EDIT already has licensing agreements in place with Juno Therapeutics $BMY and $BEAM therapeutics page 31 32 The catalysts Biotech has a lot of catalysts It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon In the short term there's drug trials A notable YOLO came from one of our very own with just shares where he turned $12k into $322k in a week Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT 301 trial and then put out a press release which caused the stock to go from $33 $99 the following weeks This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares or LEAPs are the safest choice The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials Positions 100 $23 56 10 $50c 4/16 1 $53c 4/16 20 $60c 4/16 I am long on shares and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday Disclaimer I have a degree in molecular bio and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market TL DR One of the most disruptive things ever only has a $2B market cap Your chance to get on the rocket before it goes to the edge of the observable universe 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 EDIT There's some confusion over the ticker The ticker is literally $EDIT The next

My first DD: I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshot,1330,n70cim,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/,813,1620428020.0,My first DD I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshot First of all this is all just my speculation and not financial advice I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months I am not a financial advisor or professional What I am is a physician with at least some literacy though not expertise in oncology In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training Without further ado I present my first DD I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had MD in it so it caught my attention but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC epic is the 1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar and anyone asking that probably 1 is actually a doctor and 2 doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician not much unlike the famous Dr Burry That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to do my own DD as they say Now I am not 100 sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well ok just a little well right Background I open the patent application and read up on it My first impression Lol you can't treat GBM For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer read more here that is one of the few death sentences that exist in medicine I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much Patients die within a year basically 100 of the time even with advances such as gamma knife radiation I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable But then I read more about their tech and the patent and wait a second this actually sounds legit So now to break down some of the science behind this Methods INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes To put it in non doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment due to what is called the blood brain barrier Your brain is reasonably so walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either In particular the medicine they have developed INO 5401 is a PD 1 inhibitor but delivered into the brain As soon as I saw PD 1 this peaked my interest hard anti PD 1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that uncloak cancer from hiding from your immune system The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab read more here which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug That's where INO comes in with their patented tech Results Go to the patent link above and click images This is the money shot MRI on left v bad cancer MRI on the right cancer is dead What Yep Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution Mind blowing Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD 1 inhibitors is varied Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away but only in some patients I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously Google her Conclusion Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money I go look up the study This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective phase 1 is the drug safe phase 2 does the drug work did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies I saunter over to clinical trials gov the federal website where all clinical trials are listed and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021 The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol meaning they have 99 of their data and the study is essentially complete I then saunter over to google com the worlds largest search engine and look for other data they have Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA Overall survival and Progression free survival are the holy grails of results in cancer research The fact that they have 80 progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent But again how is it that this is gonna moon soon Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences Dates May 12 May 18 Not just a one tiered moon shot but a two tiered moon shot Discussion In conclusion their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings I don't know what I'm more excited about a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon I like the stock I like the tech I like the implications to cancer treatment Disclosures No affiliation with any of the above companies I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning I have no idea what I'm doing In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from

$ASTS - The SpaceX for Mobile Phones - $6MM YOLO with Real DD,1849,o1583q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1583q/asts_the_spacex_for_mobile_phones_6mm_yolo_with/,809,1623879875.0,$ASTS The SpaceX for Mobile Phones $6MM YOLO with Real DD Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs innovations in marrying satellite technology to low earth orbit LEO applications and advances in LTE network architecture We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard Inside of SpaceX most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink which will provide FIXED POINT broadband to customers albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality They value is at $40bn This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS by way of comparison So there is a there there in terms of what we are playing for here Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO the real market is and always will be in MOBILE Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs ASTS' actual mobile solution your existing handset x200B Haha let's get back to business read on $ASTS AST Spacemobile has re imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE x200B 1 Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites This allows the satellite to do the work not the phone 2 By innovating with software $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect importantly ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications Here is the overview of the FACTS PRODUCT • ASTS is building the first of a kind and only space based cellular broadband network that is direct to device a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices • The constellation utilizes low and mid band frequencies shared with partners on a non interference basis ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use • ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks • The service will eliminate coverage gaps is compatible with all phones provides broadband data speeds and is accessible via one click on a user’s device MARKET • ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure e g towers is less developed • ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends i falling launch costs ii high smartphone penetration iii broadband demand iv 5G IoT proliferation • ASTS cites 3 3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected • Key regional opportunities include India Africa and Equatorial regions • The service is well suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back up during natural disasters MANAGEMENT • CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications sold for $550MM in 2016 • The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK Globecomm NASA and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers 34 of whom are PhDs COMPETITION • ASTS competes with high cost legacy providers including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect • ASTS also competes with the build out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial financial and technical milestones OTHER Investors include Vodafone Rakuten American Tower and Samsung all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS The dogs are eating the dog food TIMELINE • April 2019 – BW 1 was launched the test satellite validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system • 2H 2021E will launch BW3 which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024 ANALYSIS THIS IS MY OPINION AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT • ASTS is an exciting event driven story stock with open ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs significant industry backing and bone fide strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business • Management funded the seed capital for the business highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’ • Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘ big idea ’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets • The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU • The investment set up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully fund the project and remove financing risk • With 1 year lock ups on existing investors and PIPE investors there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing • Given future CAPEX Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company RISKS • While the BlueWalker satellite provided proof of concept there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed • Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service reducing appeal for full tower placement • Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution • ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk INVESTMENT CHECKLIST Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment BUSINESS MODEL ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT T given its large fixed cost base the Company expects to generate 90 asset level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow GO TO MARKET In place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to 1 3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers or directly bear the cost of churn • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1 6BN people subsequent phases expand into Europe and N America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024 DEFENSIBILITY ASTS has 750 patents as well as a first mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market CAPITAL ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation TRACTION ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction however it is yet unclear what end user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the Bluewalker 1 test satellite FINANCIALS With a market cap of $1 8bn the company is expected to generate $1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched 27MM total subscribers with an ARPU of $2 50 per user Below are projections x200B When thinking about a hypothetical valuation I pro forma the numbers and apply a multiple in line with the tower companies I treat depreciation as a real cash expense x200B TECHNOLOGY DETAILS OVERVIEW AST Science “ASTS” has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct to device’ service to normal phones BOOMBOX IN SPACE ASTS’ satellites are 10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell phone towers in space With a 900 square meter array the system is a large “loud” system that can connect with a regular mobile phone Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones SOFTWARE ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks The “magic” of the technology is the back end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum seamlessly interconnect over existing networks and talk directly to an LTE system ASTS is 6G forward compatible BACKHAUL Once the signal is collected from a handset ASTS sends the data back on B Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system The phone satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum CAPACITY Each satellite can handle 1 2MM GB per month extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area WHAT DO WE KNOW What has ASTS done to prove its system o Bluewalker1 proved the RF could close e g the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost effectively check an important element of technical diligence Bluewalker1 allowed for end to end connectivity testing which has been reviewed over the last 1 5 years o Bluewalker3 2H 2021 launch will be a scaled version of the system which will de risk components and demonstrate the full technology BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system RISKS Most of the risks are timing risks For instance Bluewalker3 could spur the need to tune microns which could delay the system deployment by months The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days BENT PIPE The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky most of the design relates to distributing power The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing DISCLOSURE I own 500 401 shares of common Yes this is a huge position You only live once invest carefully and with great vision To avoid accusations of being a shill below is proof of my position I'm grateful for the moderators working with me so that I can meet the requirements to post I have a new appreciation for the depth of validation they require I don't want to test my luck but I have a bunch of cool memes to share later made them while passing those long cold days when this stock seriously sucked x200B Proof of life or future death if this investment doesn't work Same account from mobile phone x200B x200B Some trade lots for further proof ,2021-06-17 00:44:35,ASTS:Rise,,,,,,,,,,

The Real Deep Fucking Value – KT Corporation,1856,lh2ng0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/,748,1613016829.0,The Real Deep Fucking Value – KT Corporation Apparently we’re all saying this now but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD With that being said I present you with the following I’m a fan of DFV the man but I’m more interested in really really deep fucking value This will likely be a long post but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along see what I did there For those of you kids who can’t read good I’ll put the TLDR right here at the top KT Corp $KT is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing When I say undervalued I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value At the time of my writing this KT is trading at $10 62 A realistic price target if the market were to properly value this company is $30 00 I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19 66/share What does that mean It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19 66/share This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value in the $BILLIONS but are harder to assess Again it’s trading at $10 62 as of this writing a price/tangible book value of only 0 54 Value investors typically look for stocks trading at 3 0 price/TBV Deep value would be 1 0 KT is trading at 0 54 and a price/book ratio of 0 42 Shares are cheap options are cheap Do what you will – hell sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls KT CORPORATE PROFILE KT Corporation formerly Korea Telecom is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia Africa USA Poland KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete Line of Business of Korean Market Share Mobile Services 31 4 Fixed line local telephone VoIP 64 9 Broadband Internet Access 40 9 Pay TV Services 31 6 As a conglomerate KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots Products Services of Total Revenue Mobile Services incl 5G 27 3 Fixed line incl VoIP broadband data comm 19 5 Media Content 10 1 Financial Services incl credit card solutions 14 6 Other incl IT network services real estate development 11 6 Sale of goods primarily mobile handsets 16 8 Corporate Location Map KT has 30 institutional ownership with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020 KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program For what it’s worth in this day and age the short of shares outstanding is a measly 0 09 No one is going short on this thing at its current price You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller FINANCIAL METRICS PEER COMPARISONS KT’s balance sheet is rock solid While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis it is still growing and maybe more importantly doing so profitably I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above but this cannot be understated If you were to liquidate the company entirely shareholders would receive $20 30 per share after the debt had been repaid I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT Compared to US based telecom services index peers Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26 33 $109 88 unrealistic top end Compared to industry peers/comps The following comparison is really the tale of the tape When we look at tangible book value we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value This is obvious given the share price should exceed the liquidation value But we see the opposite being true for KT Again it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares liquidate the company and double your money This is what I mean by real deep fucking value Not that we put much weight in them around here but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well with median upside of 33 They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls Everyone looks for the TLDR at the bottom I put it at the top of the post but here it is Massively undervalued $30/share realistic price target it's trading at half of its tangible book value meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares liquidate the company's tangible assets pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets This is REAL value ,2021-02-11 06:13:49,KT:NULL,,,,,,,,,,

my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀 Hello some of you might know me from my initial post before new year and my follow up post two weeks later I suggest you guys read those first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger I won't post again before merger because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price Next post will be about gains after merger Introduction another look back Well well well I have to take you guys back to the beginning After a long time lurking the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit What a journey that has been I have to remind you guys that before this post by u/WatAb0utB0b after they acquired Sweetwater basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria Then I made my post after the merger announcement still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at again a shout out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow up post some people finally took notice although still not a lot And here we are right at this very moment the entire subreddit is currently talking about it I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich There's no denying it Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels I told you guys before once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks This is exactly what happened Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now There might be minor political obstructions but there's no stopping the general movement Once the American legalization movement is done it will probably also influence European regulators Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point If it isn't already let me give you another couple of reasons why It's not about the joints it's about the CBD oil Let's be honest to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image CBD motherfucking oil I would even say it has a very positive image Most people probably think about it like this joints junkees in the park getting high CBD oil people suffering from cancer relieving their pain Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted that doesn't change the general consensus about the product You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people People will be buying drinks food even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana EU mostly Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025 Markets are fucking insane right now cannabis mania 2 0 is inevitable I don't have to tell you guys about it This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again except this time there is actually nothing holding it back The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018 There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment so I quote old pal George Soros The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people Green energy EV cannabis all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around can you guys believe it The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment Praise the lord Amen Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage TLRYtards are missing out There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria There I said it I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post but here is a small summary Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray Aphria will get a 62 stake in new Tilray old Tilray will get a 38 stake To account for this split Aphria owners will receive 0 8381 shares for each APHA share they own Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0 8381 The only risks are 1 the merger doesn't go through or 2 the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0 67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0 57 at this moment I've seen other people post about this but they are missing something As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0 8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore All you have to do is compare YOUR buy in price with the Tilray price As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0 8381 you will profit from the merger It's as simple as that TLDR Cannabis arguably best growth market for the near future or long term Aphria best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement free tendies no reason to pick Tilray This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price Positions I still have my measily 30 shares $8 74 that I've been holding since the start of December If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in I will probably buy more

discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1 1x sales The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair W Fig 2 OSTK and W relative comparisons Point 3 Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing 1 month ago institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40 through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley Allianz SE Blackrock and Vanguard as well In fact Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year Last week Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7 5 Fig 3 Bloomie institutional data Fig 4 Bloomie institutional breakdown Point 4 OSTK has short interest of over 10 With 42 77 million shares outstanding and a 40 million share float latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4 374

announced they're stepping in to resolve the semi conductor shortage CRSR held down by shorts For the smoothbrains that means CRSR is about to go 🚀🚀 I've been posting my retarded YOLO play on CRSR Position 100 x 3/19 70C 500 shares avg $39 5 Am I really eating crayons Yes I butt chugged a 60 pack of Crayola this morning so DYOR and decide for yourself First and only thing you really need to know is RGB buy But since this sub has been infiltrated by FUD filled paper handed wrinklebrain bears heres why I am on my way to the moon and it’s not too late for you RECAP Breif history of CRSR the stock blew up post IPO from $17 riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36 The float is low so swings are volatile Also lots of short volume bla bla 1/13 a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze maybe retail and/or institutional Citadel is 2 owner of CRSR float or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters who knows Cool so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap It starts climbing back to the average peak levels then 1/27 CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7 5 million shares it hits a high of $49 before a 2 day selloff Crash Boogaloo After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report with expectations of excellent numbers IV is through the roof Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable 2/9 CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report EPS beats estimates $1 7B revenue for the year profit margins way up debt is down and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages which every other tech company is dealing with too After this amazing ER the stock tops out at about $48 premarket before nosediving nearly hitting $40 Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest But looking at what actually happned it wasn't actually just hype The pre ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021 so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush sell limits were triggered self fulfilling prophecy So the price starts to fall into oversold territory Quote from Barron's Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy and one has a Hold rating on the name Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9 But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to Neutral from Buy causing the selloff to dip even lower hitting just above $40 Their justification They think gaming demand could wane in 2021 and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100 of demand due to shortages of chimps ha CURRENT SITUATION That brings us to today CRSR is way oversold $1 7B profitable revenue yet $3 9B market cap for a fast growth tech company pitiful Almost every analyst including Goldman has increased their price targets many above $50 Compare that to LOGI $2 9B revenue $4 4B TTM at $19 9B market cap and climbing fast Speaking of LOGI check out this chart 1/19 Post Earnings dip before running to ATH 2 weeks later But CRSR price is still down why my neuro atypical friends Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50 every day Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon But pressure is easing as of 1/29 short interest dropped 44 from the previous report And daily short volume dipped below 50 yesterday for the first time in months this isn't a squeeze play this means that short downward pressure is backing off IVs starting to return to earth And what also happened today The P OTUS just announced by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases We all know new players get hooked and there are tens of millions of them since last year The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market which 1000 isn't going away Without the shortages there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals this is a $65 $70 stock EASY You will not beat this entry point Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least TL DR RGB Buy Get on the 🚀 You’ll thank me in a month Or don’t listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast DYOR Clarification for all the recently acquired WSB dipshits confused how a stock could be good without 200 short interest and near bankruptcy fundamentals this isn't a squeeze play short pressure is backing off because they know it has actual legs ,2021-02-12 10:14:52,CRSR:Rise,,,,,,,,,,

this hand I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice Listen up apes I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it Now I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal or really anything with meaningful content so let's just talk about card games How do casinos make money on poker For each hand of poker played the casino takes a small percentage of the pot which is called the rake The casino provides the establishment and the dealers the players play and the casino takes its commission Okay great but what the fuck does this have to do with GME We're getting there Hang on The edging is real but you'll get your payoff So the casino takes its cut from each pot The more money in the pot the more money the casino makes Great How do they maximize profits Well they can bring in more players get players to play longer deal more hands per hour and/or increase the average size of the pots I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these because it doesn't matter What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money you just need to understand their business model Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots There are tons of ways to do this but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino you're at a local back alley gambling spot Their operation isn't super sophisticated They just install a few of their cronys into each game Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals bring people in loosen up the tables and create big pots As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table and lose it the house will profit There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money right Well that's not entirely true In fact it's not at all true Then why the fuck did I mention it Well you tell me why the fuck would you play a rigged game Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth they will still play Not all of them but a lot of them In fact it's even a good thing for the house when dumb money make money this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently The house wants you to play The house wants your friends to play The house wants everyone to play So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play Did you fucking read the last paragraph It's simple you make it the best way for anyone to make money You essentially force them to play Don't get lost in the details It doesn't matter how this is accomplished They can lick you suck you fuck you beat you squeeze you whack the other competition off etc All that matters is that whatever game they run it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery So what happens when players make too much money I don't know what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code What happens when the sheep start misbehaving A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame Again the game is rigged and the minions have one fucking job follow the script and don't get too greedy Any problem and I mean any problem is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood Reddit is an enormous echo chamber Shit gets loud in here but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big they're not going to care They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery So what the hell am I actually saying about GME The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some Epsteins but as long as the apes don't fold the apes win this round If the mobsters play this game right they'll fold this hand take their losses and as usual end up winning in the long run They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff This is EZ mode Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family a bigly minion or even the fucking godfather You live by the sword you die by the sword When you have an infected limb you first try to treat it but if that doesn't work you cut that shit off These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own I'm sure that some of them even prefer it The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder and the cannibals are going to feast TL DR Read the fucking post It took me way longer to write than it will take most of you to read it Here's some 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌🏻 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 since half of you autists need

disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this We are not triggering shit so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to Picture a roman colosseum an old stadium you mongs In the middle of the arena down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing having a jolly good time There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit so that's done They're already there shorting GME to shit not by 13 which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008 but by a staggering 50 to 130 numbers irrelevant point is the ammo is more than enough As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit so they're confident and comfortable Now for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things a boogeyman something blocking the goddamn exit The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be because they will panic

someone scooping up an extra slice of the company Ryan Cohen for example earnings blowing out anything And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment and it will soon show THEN we come We the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it What are we We are bodies Pilling up On the fucking exits The more shares you own the fatter you are and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit And my friend my friend the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership buyers that won't sell no matter what then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen Sure there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions but likely not nearly enough That's our part If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares that would be nearly 20 million shares That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available If say over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person half of WSB would own a staggering 60 of all the shares and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands some even millions Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot Heck even I with my 20 shares god bless them can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing Time really is on our side if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover GME goes straight to the MOON We don't need to worry at all there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed We need to unify clarify focus and execute x200B TLDR The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now Hype will kill this because hype dies We need to clarify our role and execute with patience We don't trigger short squeezes our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock or most of it they panic and GME moons Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can and to understand your role This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be x200B Obviously this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways

Options Greeks and why GME far OTM calls are counter productive,4601,lyu9n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyu9n0/options_greeks_and_why_gme_far_otm_calls_are/,679,1615034811.0,Options Greeks and why GME far OTM calls are counter productive I got asked to write this post to explain my opinion on GME's option trading and why I think buying far OTM C800 etc is actually bad for everyone trying to watch the price rise Before we get into any real discussion standard legal shit I'm not a financial advisor I'm not a pro This is my opinion and not advice My position I'm basically completely bled dry so I only hold one 3/19 C300 and yes I know it's a long shot but I'm deep into other positions I got the call because I begrudgingly love this sub and the autists that frequent it Okay so people want to buy FD's and get paid but it's important to understand what you're actually doing when you buy that option and pay that premium I am hoping that I won't be downvoted to oblivion because I'm actually trying to help people understand as much as I can and be more successful I'm not an expert so this is my best understanding of how options work x200B Let's talk about options Strike Price A strike price is the set price at which a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it is exercised For call options the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder for put options the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold the strike price is what everyone screams about and it's the magic numbers we want to watch the price go to in order to ensure our options are In The Money ITM If options are ITM that means that your option has value even if it doesn't go past the point where you hit a break even which ideally you want to see to realize a profit All option contracts that are ITM are subject to potential exercise and this is where the magic happens Options that expire OTM are worthless All those 3/5 C800 yes all 30 000 of them that expired Free money to the people that sold them to you Why did you give free money to the people that are going to spend it to try to stop you from making more money Well probably because you didn't understand what you were doing x200B Premium This is the money you paid to the option seller The hedge fund the market maker the theta Chad trying to fuck your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend You need to keep in mind that this money goes directly into their pocket and they don't just put it away for a rainy day They may do shit with that money to increase their chances of being correct and your chance of being out of the money OTM x200B Delta Delta is the ratio that compares the change in the price of an asset usually marketable securities to the corresponding change in the price of its derivative For example if a stock option has a delta value of 0 65 this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share the option on it will rise by $0 65 per share all else being equal At The Money options typically have Deltas hanging around 5 $ 50 per $1 of underlying price movement where as far OTM calls have extremely low Delta because they're still extremely unlikely to expire ITM Options that are ITM already have Delta's around 1 $1 for every $1 of underlying price movement because every gain is seen as a profit because you're already past the point of probability x200B Gamma Gamma is the rate of change in an option's delta per 1 point move in the underlying asset's price Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a derivative's value in relation to the underlying A delta hedge strategy seeks to reduce gamma in order to maintain a hedge over a wider price range A consequence of reducing gamma however is that alpha will also be reduced x200B Gamma incorporates time Gamma will be low and look much like a bell curve with respect to time When time decreases the price of the option is extremely sensitive to time because you have less time to see your option change in value ITM options become increasingly more likely to expire ITM and OTM options become increasingly less valuable because it would take a fucking miracle to make them ITM x200B Let's talk about orders and price movement a little What makes selling an option safe What makes it risky Ask yourself a simple question if you want to be successful are you move likely to sell an OTM call at C50 or C500 Obviously you're more likely to not get assigned your call exercise if your strike price is higher How can you understand the risk A few key concepts x200B Volume Knowing how much buying and selling happens on a regular basis can inform your intuition as to how much volatility you might expect If you see a stock with a volume of 1M you might assume from that the chance of volume of 100M is very low x200B Holding Holding your shares of your stock does a few things when we consider basic economics It lowers the supply of the desired underlying It may not have any effect at all on the demand Smart people will look at a 'cult' of people holding and understand that this is a 'control' or a constant rather than a variable on which they can incorporate to make decisions If you know people won't sell suddenly and that if you can presume that they have no more buying your a portion of your risk is mitigated by the simple fact that you are concluding a buying frenzy is unlikely to occur making sold calls safer Consider the bloodbath of the past few weeks Stocks are tumbling but GME it's basically stayed very consistent Some stocks are down 20/30 percent but GME is basically flat How people aren't selling and they also aren't buying that much x200B Open Interest Open interest is sometimes confused with trading volume but the two terms refer to different measures On a day when one trader who already holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to a new trader entering the market the transfer of contracts does not create any change in the open interest figure for that particular option No new option contracts have been added to the market because one trader is transferring their position to another However the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer does increase the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts What strikes are people buying calls for expiry 3/5 x200B Strike Open Interest In the money 30 63 Yes 40 598 Yes 45 4612 Yes 50 1597 Yes 135 5500 Yes 140 14 000 No 250 4854 No 300 5446 No 800 30 000 No All the ITM calls retained value and can be sold or exercised all OTM calls are worth NOTHING x200B Is there any surprise that it ended up this way Ending the week above $140 would have caused option sellers to either buy back or get assigned for 14 000 100 1 400 000 shares x200B If you were an option seller and you were smart enough to buy GME at $50 and you sold covered calls or naked calls at $140 and you saw it at $140 what would you do Sell your shares to lower the price Consider shorting it to lower the price Buy the underlying to hedge against the oncoming ass fucking this is a gamma sqz Literally anything but give retards on wsb 1 4Million GME shares worth of money Here's a list of the things you would NOT do Stop selling super deep OTM C800 calls Stand by and watch and risk losing your 5th yacht while working class assholes take your money x200B Jail is for poor people never forget that It's not for rich people x200B Let's look at what some folks are buying these days x200B Do you guys see what the problem is yet People are spending their money buying these retarded calls that have no chance of success x200B Remember when I said earlier that if you sell a call and you have money it's in your best interest to use that money to increase your chance of success It makes sense to spend as much much as you need to to mitigate risks If you winning cost them $100 000 000 and it will only cost them $99 999 999 99 to make sure you don't expire ITM guess what THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT THING This is the basic economics of opportunity cost For you retards that didn't take economics or don't read it means the valuable path is derived by comparing it to all other paths x200B Obviously they're not spending all of their premium to make sure options expire ITM if they were it'd be a bad trade to begin with These folks are smart they know math understand probability and have a deep understand of options arbitrage orders limits etc x200B So what am I saying TLDR Buying super far OTM calls is fucking retarded You're just handing the people you're trying to beat free money It's harder to win when you keep giving all the advantages to the people you're trying to take money from Yes of course they could become the biggest gainers but they are the last calls that will become profitable So say we had a gamma sqz to 790 and you hold until near expiration Guess what Theta option price decay over time murdered all your money because you wanted to spend all your cash on the absolutely least likely successful call Buying ATM/ or close OTM Next Strike has a very real possibility of actually making you money Those options might actually cause a price increase If people who bought calls were stacked ATM near the current market price this could very easily start a gamma squeeze Every seller doesn't want to get fucked so every single one of them is going to try to cover their own ass Like if the options were something like 135 15 000 140 12 000 145 20 000 150 15 000 SUDDENLY All of the call sellers become potential panic buyers afraid of losing their Manhattan condo Do you see the difference Every time a strike is hit the next strike becomes almost destined to be hit The amount of shares needed to cover those sold calls forces the price up if they're exercised and it's a mathimagical chain reaction The important thing to look at is what is the volume of limit sells between the strike prices if there isn't enough shares between strike prices that are within that price range it $135 going ITM makes not only $140 to go ITM but now suddenly $145 may become ITM and we haven't even dealt with $140 yet Do you get it now Don't come at with that bullshit like I'm a shill or bot either check my history I was posting DD pre GME craze If you think I'm wrong cool But don't downvote me because I'm trying to help you I wish all of you the best and I hope GME goes to $1 000 and Biden legally classifies DFV as the first living deity in human history x200B EDIT Yes I'm fully aware that you can buy far OTM calls and sell them later before expiration and realize gains if the price goes up Day trading option traders are not the target audience of this piece so fuck off kindly If you liked my post you can check profile for other shit I've written and also proof I was in on GME x200B EDIT2 Not specifically advocating for it but 3/19 is the 'quad witching' day and that typically sees crazy option levels as I understand x200B EDIT3 on 3/8 Yeah so If you heard me out and bought a C150 or C160 You'd basically be ITM literally right now as of 3/8 before lunch Have fun all ,2021-03-06 14:46:51,GME:NULL,0,,,,,,,,,

decrease x200B Ok this DD is to analyze what apes could've done better and how to address it The stock will hit 300 they said we have volume behind us they said buy near ITM calls they said /u/baturu I've just noticed the OP of that lost porn did send me a pm but I didn't reply my bad To be clear here's a quote from my Donkey Kong DD Monday Morning 3/8 🦍 🦍 🦍 optimize your stimmy 🍌🍌🍌 $GME gamma squeeze calculator update The 3/12 270C if apes were to buy one contract 3 04 x 100 $304 then MMs would need to hedge 0 137x100x137 74 $1882 worth of shares to remain delta neutral Giving an amplification factor of 1 🍌 6 🍌 OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO ers 🦍 but carry very high risk of 🦍 loosing all 🍌 if 3/12 closing price ends below 270 A safer way for 🦍 would probably be ITM calls somewhere around the 100 110C strike price This would still gives 1 🍌 3 🍌 in delta hedge amplification The 270C 3/12 was then quoted by the Forbes article on gamma swarm Wednesday Night 3/10 Imagine that a swarm of say 10 000 members each invested $1 000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12 The March 9 cost of the option is $24 If all option sellers hedged it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume at the then current prices A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk They would have covered hedged by purchasing shares – adding to the surge Gamma power What most of you degenerates did was this instead 800 207 69 0 4 0 41 0 41 0 41 1 93 82 48 27 536 29 496 0 93 860 47 Call 3/11/2021 800 202 46 0 01 0 01 0 01 0 01 2 33 99 57 76 466 36 239 2 11 615 31 Call 3/12/2021 G'damn degenerates piling into the 800C 3/12 Look that far OTM have too low delta to trigger MMs forced buying 🦍🦍🦍 is not every day you can trigger the gamma squeeze some brokers are even actively trying to block it as seen by this post from an ape being blocked buying calls and puts by his broker of fear triggering a gamma squeeze 🛸🛸🛸Tinfoil Hats Required 🛸🛸🛸 u/Heavy Ad 2498 In both cases I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME Looking at this graph the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19 and with it the gamma amplification affect With the 3/12 gone that's almost 30 of the calls OI but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30 of calls OI The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days there's still a chance for gamma I have no opinion on the short interest maybe hedgies covered maybe they printed shares out of thin air I don't know But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention span is limited to a few months a best and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE A NICE DAY she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post if u like her graphs upvote her comments $GME Price probability based on IV $GME IV Put/Call Inversion on long dated options According to her blue is the implied vol from puts red is the implied vol from calls higher IV means it's trading at higher premium so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time so in the near term puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is 50 then in the medium long term july and onward calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long dated puts I can't comment on the business transformation I'm not an e commerce expert I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc What I do know for sure is that if $GME is bought by X of float net buy EOD share price will close up Y EOD You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES If you bought shares it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20 EOD with ITM safer /ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take 18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry With the 3/12 now expired the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower around 40 MM USD net ITM safer /ATM calls needed that's about 40 000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌 TL DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI 🦍🦍🦍 together strong YOLO ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping Edit 2 From /u/JunkTheRat NEW TRADING RESTRICTIONS On GME TD AMERITRADE RESTRICTIONS ON GME Opening orders on short individual options are not allowed with the exception of cash secured puts or covered calls which must be placed through a broker If you currently own stock in one of these securities and wish to sell a covered call you must do so with a broker Please be aware that wait times to speak with a broker may be longer than normal due to current market conditions If you have no position and wish to simultaneously buy stock and sell calls against it you may enter it as a covered stock buy/write order online We May Also Implement Additional Requirements On Opening Trades On Options That Expire 3/19 Above seems to back up u/Heavy Ad 2498 claim that they were told by their Broker on the phone that they were restricted from opening a new position in order to protect Market Makers from a Gamma Squeeze Edit 2 Add more pictures with colors from /u/CalamariAce since 🦍🦍🦍 no like read EDIT 3 I see many 🦍🦍🦍 haven't grasped just how much power the gamma squeeze can contain Buying 1 Contract of 270C 3/12 on Friday afternoon 3/5 or Monday morning 3/8 at the price of 3 5USD per contract 100 shares / $ 300 with 6x initial delta amplification would have resulted in 42x amplification value of shares delta hedged by MMs in Thursday or Friday open of about $13 000 Since the delta of the contract increased 0 12 to 0 49 and the share prices rose from 137 to 260 290 within that time Edit 4 I'm not saying the short squeeze or a fundamental business

We need to talk about NOK,1727,l6rmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6rmkl/we_need_to_talk_about_nok/,640,1611850644.0,We need to talk about NOK I get it it’s not the play I’m not saying sell your GME I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young If you don’t agree with me just say so I’m also not a financial advisor so make up your own minds you autistic fucks But BUT yesterday we did something they’ve never seen Yesterday we made them run out of NOK shares That’s what that big spike was and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h If we keep doing that it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late Impossible you say Too many shares you say Well listen up Yesterday in ONE DAY we traded or caused others to trade 1bn shares of Nokia That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world That’s never happened EVER Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world 3516 16 of average trading volume Do you get it They’ll keep dumping their stock we keep buying them cheap and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY ONE DAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Why do they stop trading in NYSE Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market and once they had enough they started again That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze But then we did it again And they had to stop again The price just wouldn’t go down The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them Everyone is watching us What we do millions of normal folks do with us and every wallstreet asshole does against us What did the asshole brigade do They started shorting NOK They will continue to do that because they think we’re retards they are correct But how come the price didn’t go down It’s got 5bn shares and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there How is this going to work Because the retard brigade was buying it There’s 3m of us and counting If we each put 600 bucks on NOK we get 100 shares and that’s 300m shares Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it AND FUCKING HOLD And every dip you see you buy more AND FUCKING HOLD They'll keep dumping we keep buying until they realize the price isn't going down Then they start buying we keep holding the market runs out of NOK Price skyrockets And normies outside were following us They can see that the stock is still LOW lower than 2016 This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them So why do the normies follow us on this and not on GME I’m not saying sell GME Because GME has never ever been anywhere near where it is now That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit Not so with NOK Even with the spike from yesterday NOK is still DOWN from 2016 Remember 2016 Remember that being a really big year for Nokia No me neither And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph You know what is going to be a big year 2021 and 2022 Why What else did NOK say yesterday Well they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit what do I know I’m not a techie But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that But why would NOK be the company Well remember the 5G war with China US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China because then China has our networks But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of Fucking FINLAND Finland the land of NOKIA So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist Sorry Finnish people nobody gives a shit about you Good thing for you cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world Want proof They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON And we’re going to send them there 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But hang on why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great Answer because Microsoft fucked them That’s right they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down and then buy the phone part of the company These assholes wrecked the company the Finnish economy and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now Worked like a charm Firesale Business restructuring Lost their phones NOK never recovered The asshole they sent from Microsoft Went back to work for Microsoft and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did His name is Stephen Elop Look it up So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes But what don’t they have Money That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works But if we drive the share price up do you think that’s going to change So FUCK IT I’m in for every penny and I am HOLDING I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS TL DR NOK is literally going to the moon Go there with them 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 x200B Edit I've got a lot of messages here are my answers to the most common ones Remember I'm an idiot I don't know shit I see cheap NOK I like cheap NOK I buy cheap NOK I'm not a stockbroker or anything All I know is it's a healthy undervalued company with massive upside potential new space tech etc There is downside risk but the risk is smaller than the potential So if you invest 5k you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days Would I bet a dollar to win 100 if yesterday everyone who bet added 50 to their money Yeah Might lose a quarter but could gain 100 dollars Do I know it's definitely going to happen Of course not What happened yesterday 1bn NOK shares traded HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE Edit for the lols SAUCE ON THE 1TB 3310 STILL CHARGED UNBREAKABLE NOK,2021-01-28 18:17:24,NOK:Rise,,,,,,,,,1,

NO I'm a Momma Bear Who Just wants to Provide For Her Kids and Splurge on herself once in a while Is that too much to ask TL/DR Forbes can suck it This is my rant NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday The more I think about it the more pissed I've become about the subtle manipulative and just plain evil condescension The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT Well it was just another headfake y'all The writer was framing US retail investors as the Goliath not as the underdog as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath Its disgusting These media shills including FORBES are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars when THEY actually collude to destroy companies and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit guess what Crickets NOBODY says or does anything about it Not the media not the SEC not the FBI not the DTCC an definitely not Congress The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable But they aren't really going after the hedgies They are going after YOU ME DFV Anyone who dares pull back the curtain But when regular people see a good opportunity and want to invest LEGALLY they lose their shit I don't know ANY of you I don't take advice from anyone here I read and research and then make my own decisions But dammit I see a good opportunity so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool I've jumped on the proverbial train And I will ride it to the end of the line I'm gonna be honest I'm just tired I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces To buy myself my good vehicle or at least fix the one we have It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips I dont even like to drive across Houston just in case the engine light goes on again My credit is not great so I cant finance a car Don't say it I've already tried Twice in 18 months Every time I try again it tanks my credit further And since I'm self employed I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck Therefore the Your job is your credit financing isnt an option either So YA Momma wants a car I want to take a family vacation Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while I want to do fun things and important things like help my kids go to college IF they want to I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need If this makes me a greedy Bitch I guess I'm a greedy bitch But it DOESNT make me a criminal It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market OR that I am part of a premeditated predatory take down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty as FORBES claims ell WE are the cornered defenseless counterparty NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds Are you friggin' KIDDING ME My shares and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price WE the reddit investors are just little ants on a log riding the roaring waters of the market hanging on for dear life And if we HANG ON then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride safe and DRY We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money even maybe our lives to arrive at the end of that beautiful run Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along for playing THEIR game the RIGHT way Truth is these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes their very LIVES playing a rigged game THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed And I'm sorry if they are freaking out But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT TO BE CLEAR My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities I just want to ride the rapids To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming Not because I know I'm so deserving but because I know the numbers don't lie That's not criminal Its not even shady Its SMART I will end up in a calm peaceful lake surrounded by big beautiful mountains I will finally be able to enjoy the view I will send my kids to college buy those braces buy safe car and even go on a beautiful vacation And hey Forbes hey Cramer Hey all you crooks investigating DFV listen up THATS not greedy Its INEVITABLE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO I LIKE THE STOCK EDIT Seriously tho We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles No matter our color gender race religion or political ideology the real war is against evil and corruption For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness We wrestle not against flesh and

GME possible upcoming catalysts,3844,lp1kzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp1kzk/gme_possible_upcoming_catalysts/,636,1613956365.0,GME possible upcoming catalysts Upcoming GME “Possible” Catalysts There are some great Due Diligence posts out there regarding the short percentage on GME the hiding of the shorts game with An ETF that cannot be named here and other ETF’s and the AI model of where GME could moon at because of this I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail The high frequency trading the media and the schill accounts We all know why we are here duh it’s cause “we like the stock” Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb We don’t know exactly what will start the frenzy What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it’s no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies So here is a list of certain key items coming up 1 This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday Then it really hit when u/deepfuckingvalue followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares Fucking legend That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares This “might” be all the catalyst we need to see the moon 2 An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares Honestly we don’t know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME 3 GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter We also don’t know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction 4 Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming “Hard to Borrow” with additional rates and fees to borrow them The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party Like I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events Like it is repeated over and over again we don’t know when the squeeze will occur because we don’t know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies All we know is when it happens hold on Thank you for reading hope you are all well informed Please do outside research and don’t rely on any one person as this is not financial advice I’m just a fellow ape holding GME that’s eats the crayons my wife’s boyfriend brings me when he comes over I prefer the orange crayons I am not a cat I like the stock I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it’s great information however I don’t have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria Obligatory 🦍🦍🦍💪💪💪💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀🌛🌛🌛,2021-02-22 03:12:45,GME:Rise,1,,,,,,,,,

I am a Roblox developer and I know the absolute fucking power it

it has NOTE GAME DEVELOPER I make games for fun and do not actually work at $SEARS Not financial advice I have been seeing posts about $SEARS going public on March 10th and I am ecstatic because I truly believe that it will blow up I have been a part of the $SEARS community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works Another person and I have developed 3 $SEARS games that average a mediocre number of 500 players in total during good times of the day Let me tell you the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it It wasn't easy to make as scripting is quite hard and I'm retarded but the games are so bad yet children still play it x200B won't be sharing what those games are for privacy reasons and don't know the extent of whether or not I can get in trouble x200B How much I made in about the span of a month during Christmas time CAD x200B As you can see that is a respectable amount of money considering I split the profits 50/50 and haven't updated the game in literal months Kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform You might be thinking that it isn't that impressive but oooh boy I'm just getting started But first let me get into the details of how $SEARS actually works because it doesn't seem like many people understand it x200B How $SEARS works $SEARS makes money from people spending money on their membership called 'Premium' or from people buying their in game currency called Robux Using the Robux players can buy items from the catalogue whether it's shirts gear or hats/accessories They can also buy in game powerups for different games Everything is community made from the hats and accessories to shirts and games $SEARS used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hat/accessory models $SEARS has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the player made ones Now for how people make money $SEARS has a system called DevEx aka Developer Exchange where developers convert their Robux into actual real life currency The currency exchange rate is 0 0035 USD/Robux There are some restrictions like not being able to exchange Robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange Robux that was made from trading For more info visit Basically when someone purchases something you made you get Robux from it but $SEARS takes a pre determined of the Robux spent and sends it into the void so that they don't have to pay you as much if you DevEx This number is usually 30 $SEARS isn't just a game it's an entire fucking economy $SEARS is interesting because unlike traditional online development you don't have to pay money to keep up servers You can make anything that you want granted that it's not against TOS for absolutely free Now for the juicy stuff This will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big and how much bigger $SEARS is planning to be One thing that I have seen is people talking about how much top $SEARS developers make and the numbers are usually around 40k a month While it depends on how top you are talking about let me just give you an example of how much $SEARS developers make In 2019 a single $SEARS developer made 50 million USD Not only that but a single game has hit 1 6 million concurrent players A single game I got all of this information from the 2020 $SEARS Developer Conference But that's not all from the conference From the conference we got a chart of milestones from $SEARS CEO David Baszucki is trying to hit x200B Note that only the checkmarks mean that it has already happened Thumbs up means that it is on track A funny one I saw was the Tesla one I already know how much ya'll love sucking off Tesla and Elon They are also adding a website where you can hire scripters modellers and sound designers x200B If you are interested I highly recommend that you watch the developer conference as there is so much stuff there that I can't put all into this post Link Statistically $SEARS is bigger than ever and is growing at a rapid rate x200B x200B x200B Another thing that is coming soon that will boost players is updates to the game development engine called Studio $SEARS is constantly made fun of for having shitty games and granted that's not wrong but there are quite a few really good games out there that look pretty nice With the new updates coming games will look better than ever Here's a look at what the new terrain materials and textures will look like They don't even look like $SEARS anymore and people won't be taking $SEARS as a joke x200B x200B x200B Because of this I believe that more and more people will look to get into game development on $SEARS and skyrocket its profits TL DR $SEARS is growing at a rapid rate one person made 50 million USD from developing $SEARS games in a year and $SEARS CEO David Baszucki has huge aspirations for the company which is why I will be going balls deep into $SEARS stock when it goes public Also I have no idea why everyone's calling it $SEARS Edit I now know why people are calling it sears and changed what I could accordingly Also please stop DMing me for financial advice ,2021-02-25 00:11:03,SEARS:Rise,,,,,,,,,,

BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,5015,liixji,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixji/blackberry_is_not_a_meme_stock/,626,1613187650.0,BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry in fact is NOT a meme stock You might ask why is that Well here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing and have already developed Partnership with Amazon On December 1st BB announced a multi year agreement AWS which is Amazon’s cloud service business The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform IVY BlackBerry IVY is a scalable cloud connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data normalize it and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud Automakers can use this information to create responsive in vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences Partnership with Baidu On January 25 BB announced the expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu whose high definition maps will run on the QNX® Neutrino® Real time Operating System RTOS and will be mass produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd The milestones build on the company’s January 2018 agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry leading operating system OS the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform BlackBerry QNX BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi BMW Subaru Volkswagen GM Toyota and Honda NVIDIA is even building its AI self driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology BlackBerry IVY In addition to the QNX Operating System their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy which is a cloud based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles BlackBerry Spark Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints Through their UES they plan on improving cross platform visibility cyber threat prevention and remediation while simplifying administration Okay so why is this important 1 BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 million vehicles 2 BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers Audi BMW Ford etc view data and insights on their vehicles This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle even like a problem with the sensors the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update 3 They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products In the future we could see a shift from hardware driven vehicles to software defined vehicles 4 Not only are they focusing on this but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise Unmanaged/BYO use case Gartner Research who published the study even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare IBM and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors In fact NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack And the stock price is still $12 The Sobering Part of this DD After taking a look at their balance sheet I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued especially when compared to their competitors I mean based on this information ALONE the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion with its competitors like Palantir a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about hovering at 60 billion And funny enough Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity just like BlackBerry If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir its stock price would be $110 Final Thoughts Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company Well it’s not With their partnership with Amazon Baidu their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark BlackBerry IVY and their QNX operating system for vehicles it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s future growth Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously But only once people realize that it’s not a meme stock EDIT Well WSB mods have banned me for linking my video Oh well EDIT 2 By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy Also I forgot to mention this to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue $1 1B Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue $1 05B ESTIMATE And again BlackBerry’s Market Cap $7 3B Palantir Market Cap $55 6B So you retards are telling me to sell my undervalued stock to buy OVERVALUED stock LMAOOO 💎🙌🏻🚀 EDIT 3 Position is 500 shares $20 35 and no I did not make this post to “recover losses ” Please if you are a cynic do yourself a favor and realize that not everyone is cynical ,2021-02-13 05:40:50,BB:NULL,,,0,,,,,,,
