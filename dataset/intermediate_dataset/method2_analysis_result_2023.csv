Splendor of What Happens When Very Rich People Fuck With Each Other Following up on my excellently written and highly regarded DD post from a few days ago I'm back with some further DD Publication of this thesis makes me feel several different things 1 I feel like someone is about to make a lot of money 2 It's probably not going to be me 3 I need to visit my psychiatrist and see about getting my meds checked out You're not going to believe the level of regarded conspiracy hype / bullshit that this post is going to stoop to but before we begin let me lay out my credentials as a financial investor Just take a peep at my P L from today's efforts in the market x200B Am I beating the S P500 No I'M KICKING THE ABSOLUTE SHIT OUT OF IT This isn't even my retirement account This account is literally just a playpen where I fuck around with money Of which I have a lot Okay now that I have your attention indulge me as I try to smash my intelligence down into a condensed format that you idiots will understand You'll have to bear bare with me because when I saw that I made over 8 8 thousand dollars today I immediately blew half of it on my children's preschool tuition and wasted the other half on getting caught up on my mortgage Then I took the remaining $20 down to the local liquor store and bought a little something for myself peppermint schnapps Keep in mind that the financial advice you're receiving is not endorsed by the Hiram Walker corporation Hiram Walker and its affiliates will not be held liable in the event of any alleged malfeasance Wow team I spelled 'malfeasance' correctly on my first try Excuse me while I give myself a high five Okay so we've established that I'm an expert I'm very successful and you probably wish that you were more like me Get ready to have your mind blown But before we progress I need you to take a test x200B If you retain a financial advisor and you think that 'BuY aNd HolD' is the best investment strategy then you will choose one link If you're ready to find out how deep the Fisker hole goes then you'll continue scrolling The choice is yours and yours alone So which will it be Will you choose the Red Pill of financial security where you buy high quality stocks and hold them for long periods of time Or the blue pill where you are introduced to new chart patterns that will make you question the very fabric of financial reality The choice is yours It's an easy out and nobody will hold it against you If you're uncomfortable learning the truth about how the markets work then by all means take THE RED PILL x200B Hello x200B Are you still here x200B Wake up WAKE UP x200B How did that blue pill taste x200B Welcome to the real world A world where many people have nothing not even a Robinhood account Above them some people have hundreds of dollars enough to be secure in the knowledge that they can afford food for their family for many weeks to come Above them a few people own a useful tool like a bicycle giving them the elitist ability to travel 3 4 times faster than their foot bound peers Some people have thousands of dollars We're getting into rarified air here Privileged few have enough wealth to own a home Truly wealthy individuals have vast fortunes that stretch into the hundreds of thousands of dollars enough wealth to allow them to do no further work themselves and instead lean on their holdings to create value on their behalf In a handfull of circumstances normally inheritance people are able to accumulate wealth reaching into the millions of dollars This allows them to largely distance themselves from the struggles of day to day life These people are able to afford things like 'therapy' which is a ceremony in which people pay huge amounts of money to sit on a couch and complain But this is not the highest amount of wealth No it goes much further There are in fact people who control 10's of millions of dollars of wealth This amount of money converted to rice would yield x200B If you took 10 Million dollars to Target and just bought long grain rice you could get 1 428 571 pounds of rice Provided they had it in stock The amount of energy in a pound of rice is about Get on the stairmaster you lazy shit So if you took your $10 000 000 fortune to target and converted it to rice and then took it home and converted it to food you would have 1 428 571 x 1 655 2 364 285 714 calories That divided by the recommended calorie intake of 2000 / day would mean that if you took $10 000 000 and converted it into energy through the purchase and ingestion of target brand long grain rice you would have enough energy to last you 1 182 143 days This equates to 3 238 years or roughly 45 lifetimes for the average human And that assumes you're buying your rice at retail Knowing the above it may surprise you that some people are hoarding even more than $10 000 000 x200B You've gotta be kidding me Look you can see where I'm going with this There are a lot of people who have more money than they need to survive But the weird part about being really rich is that it doesn't mean you want to disappear and just enjoy your rice and some peace and quiet If wealth accumulation is in your nature then it will probably remain part of your nature even after you accumulate wealth One of the principles of life that is most useful is the idea that people don't change For example Dion Sanders had nothing to prove at the end of his NFL career and yet here we are he's coaching college football and starring in an Amazon series whose creative underpinning seems to stem from the fact that the word 'prime' is shared between the two relevant entities At some point money doesn't matter anymore I'll let Heath Ledger deliver the punchline to the last few paragraphs x200B If we're going to understand the markets we need to understand that the people influencing it like to pretend that they exist in a dramatic universe where there are winners and losers Heros and villains Investment bankers and Regards Their actions are meaningful because everyone surrounding them reinforces their delusion Okay so what does this have to do with the markets GREAT QUESTION AND I'M GLAD YOU ASKED I watch my stocks like a fucking hawk No candlestick goes unnoticed But what I witnessed today goes beyond any normal interpretation and frankly it blew my mind What we're witnessing is the equivalent of a hostile nation dropping leaflets onto territory they plan to invade Lets keep the Christopher Nolan theme going x200B A scene from the Christopher Nolan film 'Dunkirk' where Nazi warplanes dropped leaflets onto the few troops still occupying the area surrounding Dunkirk This is a form of intimidation meant to destroy morale Okay here's the 3 min chart for Fisker today The 3 min FSR chart from today Not a bad day overall for the stock up 9 37 It's definitely a strange chart Tons of volume and a rapid price increse up until about noon But here's the issue Starting at noon today The stock chart for Fisker from 12pm until 2 20pm today Dec 1 2023 Somebody literally drew a cock balls on the Fisker chart The stock was making nice gains and then immediately those gains were stopped and followed up by a profoundly accurate depiction of the male reproductive organs CAN ANYONE THINK OF A RIVAL EV COMPANY CEO WHO WOULD BE SO CHILDISH AND PETTY AS TO DISPLAY HIS ABSOLUTE DOMINANCE BY LITERALLY DRAWING A COCK AND BALLS ON THE STOCK CHART OF A COMPETITOR Because I sure can x200B Congratulations Sherlock you solved literally the easiest mystery in the universe Alright morons Don't make the mistake of assuming that you're privy to some sort of insider knowledge that's going to allow your children's children to pick up cocaine habits You're not there yet But what I am saying is that this Fisker chart is acting funny and I continue to believe that the elastic has been pulled very hard and that it might snap in one direction or the other and soon My positions as of market close today My positions as of market close on Dec 1 2023 TLDR When you're rich and petty enough your definition of a toy becomes very loose and you may even consider the stock chart of your competitor to be a fun little board to make some interesting doodles x200B ,2023-12-02 03:03:45,NULL,,,,,,,,,,

"Why long-duration, low-coupon treasury bonds are about to return 25%",92,180m37t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/180m37t/why_longduration_lowcoupon_treasury_bonds_are/,69,1700587000.0,Why long duration low coupon treasury bonds are about to return 25 As we know the prices of existing bonds go up as interest rates fall Some of us even know that the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates is known as duration Finally there is convexity which is the curvature in the rate of change in a bond's price as interest rates change Put all these factors together and you'll understand why those 30 year treasuries issued in 2020 or 2021 at less than 2 coupon rates lost half their market value as rates rose But what a lot of people don't connect is how this escalator can go both ways If rates fall the same bonds that tanked a year or two earlier will deliver double digit returns It seems highly probable for interest rates to fall from here whether you believe in a soft landing narrative or if you believe there will be a recession Real interest rates are at highs last seen before the GFC we've just had 525bp in rate hikes occur in 18 months' time and CPI is falling fast According to the CME FedWatch Tool there is 100 certainty among market participants that rate hikes are done and rates will be lower this time next year The shelter component is the only thing holding inflation above 2 CPI minus the shelter component was 1 5 last month and falling So it's fair to say we don't have an economy wide inflation problem anymore we have a housing bubble problem the Fed is treating as if it is inflation If rates are destined to fall soon the bonds which will appreciate most are the ones with the majority of their cash flows far into the future I e the ones with very low coupons if any Here's an example and an illustration of how the price will change Example bond CUSIP 912810SN9 a 1 25 30 year treasury bond issued on 5/15/2020 which has lost 51 of its original market value not counting interest Let's see what would happen to the value of this treasury bond if rates fell a mere 1 1 Go to an online bond price calculator like 2 Plug in the following to represent the treasury above 1 Face value $1 000 2 Coupon rate 1 25 3 Today's market rate 4 559 using the 30y rates as a proxy for a 27 5 year bond 4 Years to maturity 27 5 because the 30y bond was issued roughly 2 5y ago 5 Days since last payout 7 6 Coupon frequency Twice a year 3 Click compute bond pricing I got $484 30 which is remarkably close to the $484 84 quoted by my brokerage even though I approximated the YTM market rate and days since payout numbers 4 Now change the market rate to 1 lower 3 559 and recompute I got $597 13 a 23 3 increase in price 5 A 1 change in interest rates might occur over the span of a year or two so we need to adjust down the years to maturity variable too But this only helps the bond more because the big $1 000 payout at the end gets closer When I set years to maturity one year lower to 26 5 I obtain $605 96 which is 25 12 higher than the current calculated price Notice how I'm gaining almost 2 in value just from the passage of one year's time 6 But what if I'm wrong and rates go up 1 instead of down 1 over the course of the next year If I plug in 5 559 as the market rate I obtain a price of $406 13 which would be a loss of 16 1 This is the convexity factor If rates go down 1 this bond will go up 25 but if rates go up 1 this bond will only go down 16 The upside is literally and mathematically 9 higher than the downside The odds are definitely in your favor here Even if you think the future direction of rates is a coin toss the market is offering you a big fat advantage and you should always take a coin toss bet when offered odds in your favor Zeros If You Want To Swing For The Fences The crazy thing is there are bonds with even higher convexity than this one such as CUSIPs 912803GS6 or 912803GU1 These are strips or zero coupon bonds with a lot of years to maturity They are hyper sensitive to changing rates and only sell for about $275 for a $1k face value Why Not Just TLT or ZROZ A lot of investors are shy about buying individual bonds because the process is slightly more complex I suggest getting over one's fears and learning the process You could just invest in TLT or ZROZ but the disadvantage here is that you cannot specifically target the longest duration lowest yielding highest convexity bonds You simply get their whole portfolio Plus they are constantly turning over their assets so as the change you forecast occurs your funds are getting out of exactly the assets you'd want to be in to realize gains in that scenario I think these will do well but not as well as the specific examples listed here Nonetheless I use TLT and ZROZ to invest leftover cash in my account and interest payments as these amounts are too small to buy individual bonds with minimum lot sizes of 5 or 10 Why Not Corporate Bonds For one most of these are callable which means the issuers can just pay off your bond and take out new loans at lower rates This callable feature will reduce the gains for these bonds Secondly with corporate bonds you are taking on credit risk In a severe recession these bonds might lose some of the value they'd otherwise have due to downgrades or investor risk aversion Third bonds with higher coupons sell for less of a discount and are less sensitive to rate changes Strategic Plan If stocks fall 20 from ATH's or if a recession occurs I plan to sell these bonds for fat profits and redeploy my little green soldiers into a newly cheap QQQ while everyone else panics I have no time limit like I would with options Instead I make gains from the passage of time My thesis could pan out next year in 2 years maybe even in 3 years and I'll still make decent returns Basically I'm loaded for the ideal strategy a person could have been following prior to a 2007/2008 scenario but will make acceptable returns even in a soft landing I don't think now is a good time to be exposed to credit or market risk but I think it's a great time to be exposed to falling interest rates I personally suspect we are in a housing bubble like in 2007 due to extreme low affordability a culture of FOMO scammy investment fads and rising mortgage rates Either rates fall or prices will have to fall Either way I'm well positioned Disclosure I own the bond used as examples here some zero coupon bonds TLT and ZROZ I entered my positions in late October / early November and I'm sitting on gains so far ,2023-11-21 17:16:40,NULL,,,,,,,,,,

Fisker is worth more than 2 months of deliveries.,41,186cibo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/186cibo/fisker_is_worth_more_than_2_months_of_deliveries/,63,1701219831.0,Fisker is worth more than 2 months of deliveries First off lets get this out of the way this is a badly run company with a regarded founder who makes beautiful cars while simultaneously destroying investor value He's like the Walter White of automobiles He's a genius designer but he's yet to find his Jesse Pinkman to help him get these sons of bitches to market He also needs to find his Skyler to introduce him to the concept of accounting and the idea that financial rigor is imperative to the running of a successful enterprise The fact that they have been unable to hold onto a Chief Accounting Officer is a big issue It speaks to the fact that it's not 2012 anymore and you can't just say that you've got a car that runs on electricity and then expect the market to dive in Fisker has been playing fast and loose with their books and the market has shown them that it expects more from EV manufacturers EV manufacturing was the Wild West in 2012 Nowadays it's big business and you need to act your age not your wage That being said take a look at this car This is the design philosophy that everyone thinks is going to fail x200B The 2012 Fisker Karma For comparison let's look at a Tesla Model S x200B Tesla Model S I remember when the Fisker Karma was first released because it was a huge blow to my fragile ego It was 2012 and I was driving home in a newly purchased Porsche Cayman S and I saw a Fisker Karma in the window of a Cadillac dealership It was like a punch in the gut The Fisker Karma still stands in many enthusiast's minds as the most beautiful car ever produced x200B The Fisker Karma Revero Currently worth over $140 000 What's that You don't care about the angle of the c pillar or the gently sloping lines of the swept back profile WHAT A FUCKING SURPRISE WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT YOU IDIOTS WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THESE SUBTLE CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN So let's come up with a novel way of valuing this beaten down EV manufacturer Current market cap as of close on Nov 28 2023 $641 000 000 00 x200B Snapshot of Fisker from 11 /28 /2023 Currently Fisker has a market cap of $641 million dollars It is currently burning cash at a rate of $1 66 per share which is oddly very close to the current share price This may be why everyone expects the company to go broke in 2024 If that's true then a short would pay off 100 no matter where the short was entered $4 $3 $1 Doesn't matter If the company goes under than your short pays 100 no matter where you entered But lets look at what Fisker is trying to do here and lets try to come up with a simple way to value the enterprise and possibly cause the substantial amount of short sellers to re think who they're betting against And as for the short sellers there are a lot of them x200B Fisker Ownership with Short Interest Data from E Trade on market close 11 /28 /2023 Before the auto mods tell me to squeeze their nut sack let me just say I'm not trying to manipulate anyone into squeezing the stock I do have a few positions in FSR which I'll lay out at the end of the post but in the spirit of WSB I'm simply bringing this set of conditions to everyones attention because it seems like a setup that is ripe for volatility A degenerate could potentially make a ton of money by jumping on the bandwagon and shorting this stock into oblivion You could jump into some short dated calls and hope for an epic squeeze You could buy shares and pray that this dumpster fire makes a turn around Frankly I don't give a shit but the elastic has been pulled pretty hard and it seems like it's going to break one way or another If you're betting on failure You've got a lot of smart people on your side The stock went public through a SPAC and during the craze it predictably doubled in value before eventually slumping back to the reality of the car business where it takes a very long time to bring literally anything to market x200B Fisker stock Started at SPAC $10 value Doubled then settled into the grind I'm not arguing with the SPAC hype bubble but I am arguing with this bit right here where the stock went from $6 down to $1 84 x200B It's really just this part here that this post is about In the last month the market cap has gone down a lot and for good reason Bad earnings and the prospect that the company may be fudging their numbers is not a good look However lets take a look at a novel valuation method how many cars would this company have to sell in order to equal its market cap First off should this company survive what cars are they selling For fisker I'd argue their lineup is the best and most diverse of any auto manufacturer on earth This includes the big guys like Hyundai Mercedes GM Ford Toyota etc The Economy legacy auto killer The Fisker Ocean An alternative to any mid size SUV from any legacy auto maker Small affordable and tinted windows allow for discrete blow jobs behind your local Wendy's x200B x200B Same car but with more markups Stick tough looking stuff on reach high margins x200B The Fisker Alaska A direct competitor for Rivian at roughly 1 /2 the price $45K sticker before incentives according to their hyperbolic marketing department which is likely full of shit huffing paint and facing a lawsuit from Hagens Berman My novel method of valuing an auto manufacturer market cap / avg price of vehicles x rate of delivery This basically tells you how much AS A FUNCTION OF TIME a given manufacturer is worth for Fisker their market cap is $641 000 000 They may be lighting cash on fire but not at the rate that some would have you belive From their recent 10Q which may have been filed by an intern who was huffing high grade automotive paint shows their cash burn gives them a runway possibly into 2025 This shit's not a linear equation you moron x200B Their market cap is $641 000 000 This divided by the average price of their product we'll take an 'Ocean Extreme' for a representative sample x200B The currenly advertised price of a Fisker Ocean Extreme This gives us an initial multiple of $641 000 000 / $61 499 which is 10 423 vehicles The entire market cap of Fisker is the equivalent of 10 423 vehicles A recent headline from Teslarati If Fisker were to deliver 300 Oceans per day That would put their entire market cap at a car/day output value of roughly 10 423 / 300 34 74 If Fisker were claiming 100 profit margin the whole company would only be worth 35 days of deliveries For comparison Tesla delivered 1 313 860 vehicles in 2022 At 100 profit margin and at an average price of $50 000 Tesla would have a factor of 3600 cars per day x $50 000 $180 000 000 per day Tesla's current market cap is 750 000 000 000 or 750Billion dollars That divided by 365 gives us roughly 180 million per day At $180 Million per day it would take 4 166 days to make 750 Billion in revenue So lets compare the two Fisker has a market cap of 35 days of deliveries Tesla has a market cap of 4 166 days of deliveries Thats a big difference and I think the market has over shot both the valuation of Tesla and the imminent doom of Fisker For you brave degenerates who made it this far I'll also offer this small anecdote Without doxxing myself I am a somewhat well known filmmaker in my life outside the markets I have made several films and have contributed to emmy and oscar winning films in the action sports genre One of the big takeaways from my career spent documenting true geniuses and highly motivated individuals in extreme sports is that one of the most intensely motivating factors for these sorts of people is a simple thing spite A huge amount of talent that we see realized in the world of sports business government technology science academia etc is due to one factor simple spite More than one analyst has attributed Donald Trump's rise to power as being galvanized when Barack Obama roasted him at a press event stating that at least I'll go down as being president accusing the famous billionaire of being a 'nobody' who will 'amount to nothing' This was immediately prior to Trump's successful run for president of the united states Regardless of your personal beliefs we all know how that turned out x200B Here's the bastard you're betting against Looks like he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and went to a boarding school more expensive per year than your net worth I'll leave the final image here because this is what it all boils down to x200B The Fisker Ronin He was early but he wasn't wrong He wants your capital so that his ego can have a do over It's right there on the web site built for a category of one FYI You're not the 'one' it's Henrik He's the only one that matters here because he's filthy rich and he wants to be be in the hall of fame with Henry Ford and Elon Musk A man like Henrik Fisker has both the talent and the stubbornness to put every fiber of his being into making his company successful Not to realize shareholder value but for the glorification of his own ego and his chance to make the Karma MkII the end game / mic drop of the EV industry Regardless of what direction you regards choose this stock is unlikely to remain at its current levels for long TLDR Never bet against the ego of a talented person who has the resources and motivation to cause chaos My positions x200B Current positions including FSR x200B ,2023-11-29 01:03:51,FSR:Drop,,,,,,,,,,

Why SNOW puts will be an easy win,34,186u36f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/186u36f/why_snow_puts_will_be_an_easy_win/,59,1701276828.0,Why SNOW puts will be an easy win Yesterday I explained why CRWD calls were gonna be easy profits and got 220c's for 3 90 These calls are now 13 65 over 3x gains with the stock up almost 10 today at the time of writing Now today we're going to look at Snowflake SNOW reporting Q3 earnings on today Analysts forecast earnings of $0 159 per share as opposed to earnings of $0 110 in the same quarter of the previous year Snowflake is expected to report sales of $713 6 million an increase of 28 11 over the same period last year For the current fiscal year they expect earnings per share of $0 683 compared to $0 250 per share in the previous year On average we are expecting a revenue of $2 75 billion compared to $2 07 billion last year For those who don't know the company’s key offering is a scalable efficient cloud based data warehousing platform Snowflake’s platform enables organizations to store and analyze large volumes of structured and semi structured data Thus businesses can run complex queries across multiple cloud platforms Snowflake’s fiscal third quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base Notably it added more than 400 Snowpark customers and consumption grew roughly 70 on a sequential basis in the fiscal second quarter Big customers include Mastercard Honeywell and Disney At the end of the fiscal second quarter SNOW had 402 customers with trailing 12 month product revenues greater than $1 million up 62 year over year and 639 Forbes Global 2000 customers up 16 6 year over year Of the Global 2000 customers 63 are using Snowpark on a weekly basis Customers are accessing Snowflake for data science machine learning ML and artificial intelligence AI And this is a really hot topic because as an AI play Snowflake appears positioned for long term success if headwinds further diminish Snowflake’s innovative approach places it at the forefront of significant trends in generative AI and related tools The company introduced Snowflake Cortex a user friendly service enabling both technical and non technical users to analyze data and build AI applications A standout feature is the “Universal Search” function streamlining data location within the data lake with a ChatGPT style bot facilitating easy answers to business queries The growing adoption of Snowpark by data scientists and engineers is expected to have aided the company’s top line growth in the to be reported quarter Snowflake has been expanding its ML footprint with the introduction of ML powered SQL extensions such as anomaly detection top insights and time series forecasting which are useful for analysts Optimization Yeah SNOW's got some kinks to iron out The company faces optimization challenges but consumption headwinds are starting to chill out A return to normal consumption growth and new product introduction should support growth AI benefits are expected but the impact is uncertain Additionally Snowflake stock is trading at a P/E of 246 currently The high valuation creates downside risk if growth doesn’t stabilize The company’s outlook may be limited unless growth stabilizes Consensus analyst ratings for Snowflake stock stand at a Buy with a price target of $183 27 The stock is currently in the 170s Morgan Stanley Research analyst Sanjit Singh sees Snowflake well positioned given the multiple avenues for growth However he cautions that the potential for Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG applications might encounter increased competition Morgan Stanley has a $215 price target on Snowflake stock Piper Sandler analyst Brent A Bracelin expects earnings volatility to continue as Snowflake reports Q3 earnings The biggest debate for those analyzing the company will be tied to whether cloud optimization headwinds that have pressured growth for more than a year begin to abate he said Bottom line SNOW's got the tech and the talent to skyrocket but they gotta keep their growth game tight Keep your eyes peeled traders – SNOW's about to show us that they're a winter wonder For earnings I'm considering getting 170p Why puts After all my research it seems extremely bullish But I have to consider the moves from previous earnings despite a good report Down over 7 last time The time before 11 Even worse the quarter before that SNOW seems to go against common sense here and take a dip with good news at least 3 times in a row SNOW 12/1 170p at 4 80 works for me because it would require only a 6 drop to break even The company has seen an average of 9 move with earnings To make things cheaper you can consider a put spread Regardless just like my other posts this isn't financial advice I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too We have OKTA and DELL this week Stay tuned ,2023-11-29 16:53:48,SNOW:Rise,,,,,,,,,,

unlikely other ultra low cost carriers or ULCCs would be able to pick up the slack for bargain hunting fliers if Spirit ceased to exist x200B It would take years Chipty said for airlines like Allegiant and Frontier to sufficiently ramp up to match what is currently offered by Spirit the largest ULCC Spirit itself is planning to grow Chipty added raising the bar even higher if the company were suddenly bought out x200B The other ULCCs will have to grow at historically unprecedented rates to replace Spirit Chipty told U S District Judge William G Young x200B Taking all the ULCCs as a whole Chipty testified that it would take them five years to replace Spirit's capacity nationwide Since a large chunk of Spirit's current flights are in the efastern United States it would take over 15 years to match Spirit's capacity on the specific routes that it serves the economist said x200B As an example Chipty said that Allegiant would have to grow by 412 to match half of Spirit's capacity on Boston routes grow by 750 to equal Spirit's Miami service and 459 to fully replace Spirit in New York x200B I concluded that market entry and efficiencies are unlikely to offset the potential harm to consumers caused by the substantial loss of competition in each of the affected markets Chipty said on the stand x200B During cross examination a JetBlue attorney suggested that Chipty may be understating the scope of service provided by Spirit's current competitors Cooley LLP's Deepti Bansal displayed a slide showing the combined flights for Allegiant Frontier Avelo Breeze and Sun Country which she said totaled 1 292 routes in 2022 x200B And during this period Spirit had 351 routes Bansal asked x200B That's correct Chipty replied adding that the other airlines do not serve the same routes that would be vacated if Spirit were to exit the market x200B Another graphic showed the other airlines' routes as different colored lines which when superimposed over a graph depicting Spirits' routes effectively covered them all up in a hodgepodge of lines criss crossing a map of North America x200B The ULCCs collectively have route coverage at a network level all over the country is that correct Bansal asked x200B I am not sure how to process 'all over the country ''' Chipti said I find this map pretty uninformative There are definitely lines everywhere x200B The government plaintiffs — which include California Maryland New Jersey New York North Carolina and Washington D C in addition to the DOJ — have spent parts of three weeks trying to convince Judge Young that the planned merger would cost fliers billions through higher fares and the elimination of one of JetBlue's top competitors x200B The government has argued that getting rid of Spirit would lead to JetBlue removing seats from Spirit planes and charging a higher fare than those sought by price conscious consumers The market of other ULCCs does not have the ability to quickly ramp up to fill the void that would be left by Spirit the government said x200B Chipty also said there are many barriers that will negatively affect the ULCCs including reported shortages of both pilots and planes Judge Young prodded both the witness and the government repeatedly to drill down on her opinions only in areas that are her bailiwick x200B Now she's an expert on when the planes are going to be delivered the judge asked skeptically x200B The trial has already featured testimony from numerous airline executives including the CEOs of Spirit JetBlue and Frontier Airlines who likened his company and other ULCCs to scavengers who would clean up Spirit's carcass within weeks x200B Chipty said Tuesday that while ULCCs would certainly enter Spirit markets they would not be able to do so at the same level that Spirit had achieved x200B The question isn't whether there would be targeted entry the question is whether there would be complete entry to offset Spirit's loss she said x200B JetBlue and Spirit will begin to present their case after the Thanksgiving holiday and the presentation will last at least most of the week Closing arguments are slated for early December x200B More airline bigwigs are expected to testify including executives at legacy carriers like Delta and United JetBlue and Spirit have argued that the ULCC market is poised to grow to fill the gap if Spirit were bought out x200B A merger with Spirit could expand JetBlue's combination of lower fares and quality service nationwide the company has argued and allow it to do battle with American Delta and United as well as low cost giant Southwest Read more at Interesting to see the final DOJ witness get dunked on Surely the DOJ will try to settle rather than get dunked on further Next week JBLU and Spirit are bringing their expert witness to the stand who's certifiably regarded in the right way Followed by them calling CEOs of the big airlines to support the merger Moonsuits on or what ,2023-11-22

"$GEO = Deep Value. Trades at $10, but worth $20-25 based on EBITDA and $40 based on Replacement Cost. (Bonus: Short squeeze potential).",25,18aqh9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18aqh9t/geo_deep_value_trades_at_10_but_worth_2025_based/,46,1701714171.0,$GEO Deep Value Trades at $10 but worth $20 25 based on EBITDA and $40 based on Replacement Cost Bonus Short squeeze potential Geo Group NYSE GEO 1 Worth $20 25 based on EBITDA First way to look at it Companies that exist within the Operations and Services segment of the Real Estate sector trade at an average EBITDA multiple of 9x However Geo Group only trades at 6 4x its 2023E EBITDA of $497 5 million If Geo Group were to be valued at the multiple given to its peers its shares would be worth $20 94 per share Second way to look at it It should also be noted that approximately half of Geo Group’s operating income is generated from their Electronic Monitoring division Electronic Monitoring has far higher growth potential than Geo Group’s prisons border facilities and rehab centers as it represents a much more logical and civil way of monitoring migrants as opposed to holding them in custody See growth potential below in Figure 1 Due to this high growth potential a much higher multiple should be placed on the earnings from that business So overall to be more accurate one should apply a 9x multiple only to the traditional half of Geo Group’s business and a higher 15x multiple to the Electronic Monitoring half of the business This results in a blended multiple of 12x This multiple is not excessive it is actually in line with the overall stock market and results in a Geo Group valuation of $24 97 per share 2 Worth $40 based on replacement cost As an alternative way to determine the fair value of Geo Group shares we can look at the replacement cost of Geo Group's assets minus its liabilities To calculate the replacement cost of Geo Group's assets I researched the construction cost of 25 recently built prisons in the United States However because prisons are different sizes I looked at their construction cost on a per bed basis The cost was $220 061 per bed Given Geo Group owns prisons with 53 998 beds that implies a $11 9 billion total replacement cost Now that we know the replacement cost of GEO’s facilities we can calculate the replacement cost of the rest of the company To do that we take the value of the company’s facilities plus the value of the company’s cash and receivables of $0 6 billion less all liabilities of $2 5 billion $11 9 $0 6 $2 5 $10 0 billion Divide $10 0 billion by 123 5 million of shares outstanding $80 91 per share But aren’t new facilities worth more than older ones Yes GEO’s Secure Services facilities were built on average in 1998 Rule of thumb is that industrial building values decline at 2 5 per year That means $80 91 per share for buildings built in 2023 $35 78 per share for buildings built in 1998 But also importantly all of the facilities have been renovated The renovations would add back at least 10 to the value of the facilities And $35 78 x 1 10 leaves us with a replacement cost of $40 88 per Geo Group share See Figure 2 below 3 Bonus 15 Short Interest Major short squeeze could get triggered If the aforementioned deep value thesis is not compelling enough also know that Geo Group has a 15 short interest This is not as extreme as the 25 35 short interests one sometimes sees but Geo Group’s deep undervaluation has two important short squeeze related implications 1 Geo Group could triple based on fundamentals alone trapping shorts Unlike almost every other stock with a high short interest a massive squeeze could get triggered just due to a normalization of Geo Group’s valuation Therefore shorts could find themselves on the run and trying to cover their positions causing even more buying well before any involvement from the Reddit/WallStreetBets crowd 2 Reddit users can risk far more capital on Geo Group vs other meme stocks Last year when I ran some numbers only 3 of the 25 most talked about meme stocks/short squeeze candidates had positive earnings Because Geo Group trades far below its fair value while every other meme stock trades far above their fair values Reddit users can risk far more capital investing in Geo Group Very simply which meme stock are you more comfortable owning I know I’d be as comfortable investing $15 000 into a stock that trades at 6x earnings as I would be investing $5 000 in a stock with no earnings The bottom line is that APES have triple the ammo bidding up Geo Group shares vs other highly shorted meme stocks x200B Disclaimer Prisons owned by private companies are subject to the same regulatory standards as government owned ones And we all know the government never exceeds minimum standards Furthermore because Geo Group is a publicly traded company there is a strong incentive for executives to ensure employees and managers don’t do wrong things Otherwise scandals create negative publicity a lower stock price and unhappy shareholders – all of which directly negatively impact executives and their stock holdings However in government owned facilities there is no mechanism to ensure that bad employees or managers are held responsible for their actions Think of schools or police forces – their bad employees get away with almost anything This post does not constitute investment advice ,2023-12-04

Bullish on CD Projekt RED ($OTGLY) ahead of 11.28 earnings. (Long post),5,184kgfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/184kgfn/bullish_on_cd_projekt_red_otgly_ahead_of_1128/,35,1701031804.0,Bullish on CD Projekt RED $OTGLY ahead of 11 28 earnings Long post Summary x200B Bullish Outlook on CD Projekt Red OTC OTGLY Anticipation of upward revisions in top line consensus estimates post Q3 results on November 28 2023 Key Drivers Robust performance of Cyberpunk 2077 the Phantom Liberty expansion and renewed interest in The Witcher 3 due to upcoming mod tools Q3 Revenue Projections $160 $200M bolstered by underestimation of Phantom Liberty's impact on base game sales and the successful release of the 2 0 patch Acquisition Prospects With Sony and Microsoft actively seeking exclusive content CDPR's valuable IP portfolio make it a prime high value acquisition target Introduction I maintain a bullish outlook on CD Projekt Red CDPR anticipating that the results due on November 28 2023 will prompt upward revisions in both top and bottom line consensus estimates for the upcoming quarters The robust performance of existing properties including Cyberpunk 2077 CP2077 with its recent Phantom Liberty PL expansion and renewed interest in The Witcher 3 TW3 due to the upcoming dev supported mod editor will catalyze growth through the early quarters of FY24 x200B OTGLY 8 1 2022 11 17 2023 Current Projects and Market Speculation CDPR's tight lipped stance on the development cycles for 'Sirius' and 'Orion' continues to intrigue the market Sirius the potential next chapter in The Witcher series and Orion the sequel to CP2077 are critical to the company's future The limited information provided about Sirius's launch in the Q1 call suggests a cautious approach towards release dates a lesson from the now infamous CP2077 launch in 2020 The studio's decision to reduce its development staff by 10 partly due to discontinuing support for 'Gwent' and overhauling the development framework for Sirius reflects a strategic shift With the staffing adjustments now complete and the team behind PL’s development available since September for reassignment to projects Sirius and Orion CDPR management might be more forthcoming about release schedules in upcoming quarters Given that PL marks the final major release before The Witcher 4 TW4 delaying TW4's release beyond 2026 appears impractical for both CD Projekt Capital Group and its parent company CD Projekt S A This inference aligns with their previously stated goals concerning product release frequency From my perspective a 2025 launch for TW4 seems almost certain with a strong likelihood of it being in Q4 I expect the studio to announce this target in the second half of 2024 Beyond revenue implications this timeline and announcement are in my view driven by a strategic objective positioning the studio optimally for a potential acquisition Financial Outlook and Acquisition Potential The ordinary shares of CD Projekt Red have publicly traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange WSE for over a decade Meanwhile the USD denominated American Depositary Receipts ADRs listed under the symbol 'OTGLY' on the OTC markets began trading November 2019 Prior to the launch of CP2077 – a release that was among the most eagerly awaited in gaming history – OTGLY reached its peak exceeding $31 in September 2020 However the tumultuous launch initiated a sharp and protracted downturn lasting over 20 months bottoming out in September 2022 when the shares momentarily dipped below $4 Despite ongoing speculation about Sony's interest in acquiring CDPR the studio has consistently expressed a preference for independence This sentiment has been a cornerstone of their corporate philosophy as reaffirmed in their latest communication from May during the most recent round of speculation regarding a potential deal with Sony Public companies inherently have a responsibility to consider any proposal that could potentially enhance long term shareholder value a legal fiduciary duty held by their boards The debacle surrounding the launch of CP2077 marked a low point for CD Projekt Red both operationally and in terms of its reputation The incident represents a significant blemish in the studio's history one unlikely to be forgotten by consumers However it is instructive to revisit the pre launch valuations and financial metrics to assess the long term value maximization for shareholders At the beginning of 2020 CDPR's enterprise value EV was approximately $7 11B with a cash flow from operations CFO of $57M over the preceding twelve months Just before CP2077's launch in December EV surged to a record high of $11 44B and the LTM CFO for 2020 concluded at over $190M Although EV declined alongside the stock price in subsequent quarters a noteworthy uptick occurred in April 2021 The Q4 results for the calendar year 2020 revealed a CFO of more than $270M for the quarter a 50 increase compared to the LTM total for CY2020 Despite the controversies legal claims brand value damage and the costs incurred for remedies including the 2 0 patch CP2077 has achieved undeniable success In October CDPR announced that CP2077 had surpassed 25 million unit sales ranking it as the 41st best selling video game of all time For context TW3 released 5 5 years earlier in 2015 stands as the ninth best selling game with over fifty million units sold This translates to an average sales rate of approximately 8 3 million copies per year for CP2077 compared to 5 8 million per year for TW3 The 2 0 patch significantly restored the goodwill lost after CP2077's initial release with fans recognizing it as the game they had anticipated Additionally the PL expansion received nearly universal critical acclaim a rare achievement in gaming In its first week alone the expansion sold over three million copies with a sizable portion from pre sales The success of these pre sales especially considering CP2077's history underscores the existence of a dedicated and trusting fan base x200B Top Consensus Bottom Analyst Analysis of Sales and Revenue I anticipate that the Q3 results to be released on November 28 2023 will surpass the top line consensus estimates significantly even exceeding the current highest revenue forecast of around $125M with the average consensus standing at $108M This expectation primarily stems from a widespread underestimation of the impact that PL sales have had on the sales of the base CP2077 game The success of the expansion coupled with the release of the long awaited 2 0 patch just prior to PL’s release is poised to boost base CP2077 sales well beyond that suggested by historical averages alone From an analyst's perspective the 2 0 patch serves as a significant yet understated driver of sales—a factor likely overlooked in forecasting models for CP2077's unit sales Patches while common and anticipated in ongoing game support seldom overhaul a game's core experience to the extent seen with CP2077's 2 0 update Typically patches represent a continued support cost and not expected to spur unit sales However the 2 0 patch breaks this norm with its comprehensive enhancements to CP2077's gameplay mechanics and systems an almost unprecedented move in the industry The overwhelmingly positive reception of the 2 0 update positions it as an independent catalyst for CP2077 unit sales creating a unique feedback loop that is atypical in the gaming world The initial success and critical acclaim of PL are already contributing to increased interest in the base CP2077 game What is particularly intriguing is the potential reciprocal effect where the rejuvenated interest in CP2077 fueled by the 2 0 update could further drive the demand for Phantom Liberty This dynamic is likely to sustain strong sales for Phantom Liberty well beyond the Q3 and Q4 holiday quarters I contend that analysts tracking CD Projekt Red have significantly undervalued the demand for Phantom Liberty with even the most optimistic Q3 top line projections appearing overly conservative in terms of unit sales expectations To substantiate this claim I refer to excerpts from the Q2 conference call on August 30th During this call only one analyst attempted to project PL unit volume by suggesting an 'attach rate'—a method that estimates expansion volume as a simple percentage of base game sales x200B However defining a standard value for this rate is challenging Furthermore management offered no assistance in determining an appropriate rate and explicitly stated that such guidance had not been provided in the past and would not be in the future x200B Estimations and Projections A simplistic attach rate applied to existing base game sales fails to account for the surge in CP2077 sales preceding the PL launch a result of the demand generated by the 2 0 update This oversight also neglects the potential for sustained sales into future quarters in 2024 as renewed interest in CP2077 should lead to additional expansion purchases To illustrate how consensus estimates for Q3 might be underestimating Phantom Liberty sales consider the chart above that shows the changes in consensus estimates over time After the Q2 call in August the top line expectations for Q3 dropped to approximately $70M and remained unchanged until the first week of October This estimate is particularly revealing as it implies less than $35M in incremental revenue compared to the $36M reported in the previous quarter Even if we assume that all incremental revenue in Q3 is attributable to expected expansion sales this will mean only about one million units sold at an average price of $30 each Notably this estimate at that time was based on the analysis of just two analysts At the investor day event on October 5th CD Projekt Red confirmed that PL’s first week unit sales exceeded three million This milestone combined with CP2077 reaching 25 million unit sales has led to revised upward projections for Q3 and Q4 revenues along with an increase in the number of analysts contributing forecasts This trend persisted through November As of this writing the median top line estimate for Q3 stands at $105M However the highest estimate at $125M most compellingly suggests that these expectations may be far too conservative Despite being 25 higher than the median $125M accounts only for the three million units of Phantom Liberty already confirmed by the studio x200B The annual unit sales rate for CP2077 as mentioned earlier is approximately 170 000 copies per month To gauge a more realistic expectation for Q3 refer to the chart above which plots the sales milestones as confirmed by the company The twenty five million sales figure includes five million units sold in the twelve months ending September 2023 averaging over 415 000 units per month While detailed 2023 monthly sales data is not available the fact that both the expansion and the CP2077 base game topped Steam’s weekly bestseller list in the weeks leading up to the September 26 release suggests that this higher monthly average might be heavily skewed towards the release quarter Therefore base game sales for the quarter calculated using the stated average imply quarter unit sales of 1 2 million copies A more assertive estimate doubling this average would indicate sales exceeding 2 2 million units The estimates outlined above could result in an additional $50M to $100M in revenue beyond that anticipated from the Phantom Liberty expansion alone Consequently I project Q3 revenue to be in the range of $160M to $200M with Q4 mirroring these figures Looking further ahead the release of a developer supported mod tool for TW3 in 2024 should rejuvenate interest in this already popular title and provide an additional catalyst to the studio’s top line results This catalyst is also unlikely to be fully appreciated within current valuation models While mods for TW3 are not a novelty the introduction of a tool that allows for the creation of new questlines is unprecedented offering a fresh dimension to the modding community Committing to a 2025 release date for TW4 announced sometime in 2024 strategically positions the company to maximize benefits from any potential bidding war among industry giants like Sony and Microsoft Sony's interest in CDPR is already a matter of public knowledge while Microsoft has demonstrated a readiness to invest heavily in exclusive content to establish Game Pass as the leading gaming ecosystem for PC and console platforms CDPR with its prestigious portfolio of proven IPs is well positioned to command a significant premium in the market This value coupled with the company's desirable IP portfolio could translate to a substantial acquisition price especially when compared to recent transactions in the gaming industry ,2023-11-26 20:50:04,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of closing arguments from Spirit/Jetblue vs DOJ case.,13,18bpbfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18bpbfb/summary_of_closing_arguments_from_spiritjetblue/,34,1701817731.0,Summary of closing arguments from Spirit/Jetblue vs DOJ case Law360 Boston December 5 2023 2 44 PM EST While hearing closing arguments in a month long bench trial a Massachusetts federal judge weighed Tuesday whether he could strike a balance between permanently barring a proposed $3 8 billion merger between JetBlue Airways Corp and Spirit Airlines and letting the deal go through as is During more than two hours of arguments in the closely watched case U S District Judge William G Young peppered both sides with questions about what an outcome might look like that allows the deal to go forward — but with additional divestitures that might help buoy the market for bargain hunting fliers who would be harmed if Spirit ceased to exist The U S Department of Justice and several states sued to stop the merger arguing it would harm competition by removing a so called ultra low cost carrier and cost consumers billions of dollars through higher fares and fewer seats on planes The airlines have countered that a merger like this is the only way Spirit can survive and the only way to compete with the big four carriers that dominate the market United American Delta and Southwest JetBlue attorney Ryan Shores of Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton LLP said during his closing argument that the company has agreed to significant divestitures to help out other ULCCs and allow them to enter markets currently served by Spirit My question is accepting all that what if I were to say 'These are fine but we need a little more ' Judge Young said asking if he should hold further hearings on the potential remedy You absolutely can your honor Shores replied And my question is should I the judge asked As opposed to a full stop injunction the court should hold a remedy hearing if it determines there is any harm from this merger which we of course deny the attorney responded Judge Young had floated the notion of ordering unspecified additional divestitures at various points during the trial which drew crowded galleries and a lineup of airline industry bigwigs at various points JetBlue's CEO testified that the big airlines have no reason to sweat his company's deal with Spirit and a United executive told the judge his airline would aggressively target budget conscious fliers Judge Young also heard from Spirit's board chair who said there were no profits on the horizon for the bargain carrier and the merger is needed Tuesday's closing arguments which at times seemed more like appellate oral arguments with the judge's frequent questions and interjections drew an audience so large that nearly two dozen people stood behind the packed benches and two dozen more occupied an overflow courtroom two floors below When asked by the judge about the prospect of additional divestitures to sweeten the deal from the government's perspective DOJ attorney Edward Duffy said he could not imagine anything that would make up for Spirit exiting the marketplace Looking at the nature of the harm it is difficult for me to envision what type of remedies could offset this You're talking about a significant reduction in capacity a loss of a ULCC competitor Duffy said The extent of the harm we discussed there does not seem to be a remedy other than a full stop injunction that would restore competition But Judge Young said he was struggling with whether a permanent block on the deal made sense in what it seems quite clear to this court is a dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in this post COVID environment Don't you think I ought to build in some future review or way to see if whatever determinations I make here can be rethought if my assumptions are incorrect Judge Young asked Duffy The attorney said the deal cannot exist in its present form and under the current and foreseeable market conditions This is a softball question this question jumps to the end and presumes the government prevails here I am having trouble with a permanent injunction Judge Young replied Maybe a permanent injunction is too restrictive That's what I am suggesting What sort of limitations should I put on it The injunction would be limited to the deal in front of the court Duffy said Another deal would be another case Judge Young replied drawing an echoed response from Duffy Judge Young cautioned both sides before the start of the two hour hearing and the packed gallery that his questions should not be taken as an indication that he had made up his mind one way or the other Further briefing in the case is expected on Dec 13 While the DOJ's track record in recent antitrust proceedings has been mixed the government did score a victory in a similar trial last year seeking to block JetBlue from forming a partnership in the Northeast with American The two airlines gave up on the deal after the trial setback In making his final oral pitch to Judge Young Shores argued that four weeks of trial 90 exhibits and 22 witnesses have not changed the fact that the big four hold 80 of the airline market and that this deal would not alter that power balance The competitive landscape fundamentally shifted years ago in favor of the dominant carriers Shores said That is why JetBlue began considering a merger with Spirit with one main goal to create a viable disruptive national challenger to the industry's dominant airlines That mandate is even more urgent today Shores said the divestitures that are already part of the deal including coveted slots at airports like LaGuardia in New York City are going to turbocharge other ULCCs like Allegiant and Frontier whose CEO testified during the trial that he envisioned a frenzy of competition to replace Spirit But the DOJ's Duffy said that the fliers who would be hurt the most are those who rely on Spirit as a bargain alternative Counting on other ULCCs to fill the void requires making assumptions that are simply staggering he said The court would have to believe that ULCCs would have to grow faster than they ever have before that they would take on legacy airlines in a way that they never have before and that they would fly to places at odds with their established business models he said Perhaps they view that harm to those least able to bear it as just the cost of doing business but that's not the law in America Duffy continued This transaction is a bad deal for consumers The government is represented by Edward W

cards Zoom Video Communications ZM will be releasing their stuff today so we get to see how they've fared this recent quarter Wall Street expect them to report earnings per share of $1 08 Revenue of $1 12 billion a slight increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $1 10 billion Zoom’s forecast for the January 2024 fiscal year calls for revenue of between $4 485 billion and $4 495 billion up 2 with adjusted profits of $4 63 to $4 67 a share Consensus estimates call for revenue of $4 492 billion and earnings of $4 68 a share With the coronavirus emergency over the company's share price has been on a rollercoaster lads We're talking cutthroat competition and growth hitting the brakes But here's the kicker Zoom's gotta level up in the corporate jungle if it wants to keep its revenue game strong The company has been seeking to grow by moving beyond its flagship web meeting service It has added software for contact centers webinars chat and email plus new artificial intelligence AI tools among other things But growth remains slow The stock has retreated 5 so far this year with the Nasdaq shooting up 36 amid buzz over generative AI technology Today Zoom is likely to post its sixth straight quarter of single digit revenue growth But on the plus side Zoom Video has about $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet they're sitting on a treasure chest boys and with this we should expect more acquisitions In a research note previewing the quarter Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall dropped some knowledge in a research note the stock isn’t likely to move much until investors feel more confident about the company’s “online” business the smaller customers who flocked to the platform during the pandemic Marshall's playing it chill with an Equal Weight on Zoom Another key question Marshall mentioned is when some of Zoom’s fresh toys might spur a reacceleration in the company’s enterprise business And she also wonders when Zoom might use its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions As mentioned earlier Zoom has $6 billion in cash and short term investments equal to about 31 of its market capitalization Important Factors Zoom’s fiscal third quarter performance is likely to have gained from steady demand for products like Zoom Video Webinars Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phones An expanding portfolio of solutions is expected to have aided customer growth in this soon reported quarter The company’s AI related advancements and partnerships in the fiscal third quarter are noteworthy Zoom adopts a federated approach to AI utilizing its own exclusive large language AI models as well as models from renowned AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic In the to be reported quarter ZM threw down its generative AI digital assistant into the mix Rather than increase revenue Zoom Video expects AI tools to retain customers At its annual Zoomtopia user conference in early October the company said it will not charge customers for use of its AI Companion That's right They dished it out FREE for the Zoomers with paid accounts Talk about a power move This is totally expected to be a key growth driver Its capabilities include meeting/chat summaries and smart recordings In this conference the company announced new platform innovations that leverage robust AI capabilities aimed at simplifying the workday by providing efficient communication and collaboration tools Zoom Video is racing to build more artificial intelligence tools into its business communications platform Zoom Video recently backed off from a change in its terms of service for platform users that would have enabled it to gather data to train AI models Set for release in 2024 Docs is an AI powered workspace that can be used for documentation project tracking and management tasks Meanwhile recently told its employees to report to its offices on a more regular basis Amid Covid 19 emergency demand for Zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home Also Zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as making video calls became routine for consumers to keep in touch with family and friends Remote learning and needs in telemedicine also boosted demand for Zoom Video's cloud based services The availability of Zoom Clips which allows users to easily record edit and share high fidelity short form video messages both internally and externally is likely to have aided enterprise customer growth in the to be reported quarter The company also announced the launch of Notes a fresh workspace designed for creating and collaborating both before during and after meetings Zoom Video aims to integrate AI into more products At the Enterprise Connect conference in March Zoom Video announced the expansion of a workplace collaboration platform Called Zoom IQ it summarizes chat threads organizes ideas drafts content for chats emails and whiteboard sessions and creates meeting agendas In May Zoom announced an investment in AI startup Anthropic to support research roadmaps Anthropic's AI model will be integrated into Zoom's Contact Center platform Zoom Video in July rolled out Zoom Workforce Management which improves agent productivity by automating/optimizing agent work shifts and monitoring agent performance The consensus estimate for enterprise customers in the fiscal third quarter is currently pegged at 221 336 One key to Zoom's success has been a freemium business model Zoom's basic video calling package is free They put a limit on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings Zoom software gets high ratings for ease of use and simplicity following earlier video services that provided jerky images and out of sync audio The company’s freemium business model helps it win customers rapidly whom it can later convert into paying customers In the fiscal second quarter customers contributing more than $100 000 in revenues in the trailing 12 months grew 17 8 to 3 672 These customers accounted for 29 of revenues up from 26 in the year ago quarter The momentum is expected to have continued in the to be reported quarter the number most likely well above 3 700 now A Zoom Meeting refers to a videoconferencing session hosted on its cloud infrastructure Paid Zoom business plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats Zoom Phone a cloud calling product rolled out in 2019 lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video The Zoom Phone replaces traditional business PBX phone systems Zoom reached 5 5 million paid phone seats at the end of 2023 up over 100 year over year said Baird's Power The company expects that to become a 10 revenue segment early this year and perhaps as high as 25 in the future However the company has been facing significant competition from the likes of Cisco Microsoft and Google Meet This might have led to a loss in small and medium sized business customers which is likely to have hurt top line growth But let's talk competition specifically with Microsoft Sales growth slowed for the ninth straight quarter as the company adjusts to slower product demand in the post coronavirus emergency era See I'm left wondering when decelerating sales will hit a bottom Zoom's cloud based software sets up video calls with chat tools available Also customers can easily share content Microsoft and its Teams communications tools are pretty much offering the same and are Zoom's major rival in the business market Microsoft is upgrading its products with technology from startup OpenAI The company in early March said company President Greg Tomb a former cloud computing executive at Alphabet's Google will leave They also mentioned in Feb 7 that they will cut 1 300 jobs or about 15 of its workforce As the coronavirus crisis eases retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to Zoom's success For customers with one to 10 employees renewals are expected to slow as the economy reopens and shelter in place orders lift There's expected to be less turnover of larger customers In the business market Zoom rivals include RingCentral RNG Cisco Systems Google and others Growth in annual recurring revenue for business customers with contracts topping $100 000 is one metric to monitor In July 2021 Zoom Video and Five9 FIVN which automates call center services announced a deal to merge The all stock deal was originally valued at $14 7 billion But the companies terminated the agreement on Sept 30 Zoom Video aims to be a player in the contact center market with its own products and services What to do for earnings Over the last 2 years the shares averaged a move of 7 4 with earnings regardless of direction Options currently are pricing in a bigger than usual move tho I'm going to consider this a lotto play and grab calls 11/24 70c 1 42 Why Because I believe it's really time that they turn things around with their AI usage and increasing customer base If earnings are bad it's simply not going to crash low enough for puts to be profitable However with expecations pegged at where they are calls might be the move here Keep in mind like my other posts this isn't financial advice I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too Later this week we have NVDA ,2023-11-20 20:49:42,ZM:Drop,,,,,,,,,,

VZ Stock Analysis,16,18a89la,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18a89la/vz_stock_analysis/,28,1701651117.0,VZ Stock Analysis This is my first post on this sub so felt I’d give some analysis on a company I’ve been heavily interested in First let’s start with the biggest competition in their respective industry The two biggest challenges to Verizon are T Mobile and AT T the two biggest providers of cellular service besides VZ T Mobile’s best plan appears to be the Magenta plan $70 a month with unlimited 5G premium data They have many plans and constantly advertise their services online and on commercial advertisements but let’s look towards the future A few months ago they announced a new plan Go5G Next which according to their own press release is “the only plan in wireless where customers are upgrade ready every year with the promise existing customers will always get the same deals as new customers ” So with a big chunk of phone users using T Mobile and a future plan that seems to appeal to their current customers I don’t see them going anywhere soon Now let’s look at AT T after a merger between WarnerMedia Discovery investors seemed bullish on the companies stock performance but that was short lived The stock was trading at $22 a share back in April 2022 but has only fallen since trading at $16 a share present day So what has happened to one of the biggest providers since Mainly two things Amazon’s potential service providing ideas and the CFO of the company Pascal Desroches stating they expect a slowdown on phone plan subscribers Despite this I don’t believe AT T is a failing company with little competition they should still be a player in this field But what about Verizon It feels they’ve been in the negative light lately They had a bad report earlier in the year come out claiming they were exposing people to toxic lead sheathed copper cables They have not so pretty debt issues and haven’t been performing great in the past half decade so why am I bullish on this company Well let’s get into it Let’s star with the companies financials the best indicators I’ll begin with one of my favorite numbers price to book ratio VZ’s price to book is at a very low 1 65 currently in almost all cases a great value indicator for a company The company also has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 7 0 currently another great value indication Price to earnings are at 7 72 which follows another undervalued indicator But this should be pretty obvious to most investors so why is it undervalued is the real question Well the first answer is the glaring long term debt they’re in As of Q3 they have $155B of long term debt a large number for many companies but almost all of it has been used to finance new ideas and ventures in the company Yes it is somewhat concerning to be in a large amount of debt especially with the “higher for longer” rate situation we’re in if they were to be forced to refinance But despite that the company has almost $380B in total assets and a debt to assets ratio of 0 45 which is pretty healthy They saw over $100B in total consumer revenue in 2022 and it’s expected to grow for 2023 With the amount of revenue generated and with the company expected to pay around $3 6B in interest I feel comfortable with their debt issues and don’t see it affecting the companies expected growth With a new CFO Tony Skiadas determine to pay down debt and rollout new 5G plans I feel confident in this company on its financial side Now what about the consumer side What would attract people towards Verizon instead of T Mobile AT T and other providers Well Verizon plans to continue deploying 5G using C Band spectrum which they won at a 2022 auction Verizon spent $53B for a large block of C Band spectrum a big commitment towards their future The new CFO said it would “give customers a much better experience” reaching over 100 million Americans with faster service They won full access to its C Band spectrum with an agreement with the FAA and were cleared by satellite companies allowing much faster service across the country But why would customers choose Verizon Well they came out with “My Plan” a differing idea from conventional wireless plans with it customers will be able to pick and choose what they want out of their plan and offer more options and flexibility to their customer base With these two appealing selling points there’s no doubt in my mind that Verizon will retain and more than likely grow their customer base in the future With an undervalued company finally answering their biggest red flag sitting as a big competitor in an innovative industry and a potentially growing customer force I see undeniable growth in a company that used to be the standard in wireless services I expect many investors to follow suit in the over 10 upswing in share price we’ve seen in the last month I’m giving VZ a price target of $52 for eoy 2024 with a max upside of $60 a share If you read all the way to the end of this thank you for your time and I hope you have a good upcoming year in the market With that I’m going to go nut to pics of Natalie Portman from the 90s finance yahoo com/news/verizon too

high 15 78x and 65 85x Compare that to the industry's measly 2 63x and 14 63x and it's like CRWD's playing chess while everyone else is stuck on checkers And if that wasn't enough to make your head

Clear Mispricing - Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) / JetBlue (NYSE:JBLU) Merger,6,18c9mbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18c9mbj/clear_mispricing_spirit_airlines_nysesave_jetblue/,5,1701884944.0,Clear Mispricing Spirit Airlines NYSE SAVE / JetBlue NYSE JBLU Merger I mostly trade special situations and cannot believe the market inefficiency with Spirit Airlines NYSE SAVE / JetBlue NYSE JBLU It seems like Spirit trades as if it is a triple levered JETS ETF moving with strange volatility in the direction of airlines each day Of course Spirit's stock should not be completely market agnostic but the traders do not appear to be reacting to the information in the trial resulting in strange swings and maintaining this crazy 100 premium if the deal goes through The judge is an absolute professional and asked many hypothetical questions for both blocking and approving the merger giving little away I do not think I need to go through the thesis for the merger approval but even before the DoJ began fumbling their way through this case most experts agreed the case was skewed in JetBlue and Spirit's favor The only thing I can rationalize is that the market expected the judge to give an indication of what direction he was leaning prior to his ruling and is now upset that they will have to wait a few extra days The market is pricing this deal as if it expects just 1/4 odds of approval which is clearly not the case A funny part about this mispricing is that the Alaska / Hawaiian deal has a way smaller spread and if Spirit gets blocked there is no chance Alaska / Hawaiian can go through as they overlap on so many routes way larger anticompetitive impact regardless of market definition Last thing the flailing firm defense although it cannot be cited here in the trial almost guarantees the merger gets approved This judge has had an extremely respectable career and this is his swan song If Spirit goes bankrupt post injunction it will leave a stain on his legacy so he will do everything within the law to make this merger happen ,2023-12-06 17:49:04,"SAVE:Rise,JBLU:NULL",,,,1,,,,,,
