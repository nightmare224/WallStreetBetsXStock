The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,55371,l97ykd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/,8027,1612109430.0,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation I have been following GME since mid September and over that time I have banked myself a 1300 return in the process However the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been especially this week The company had more than 100 of its stock sold short That's never happened before you say I know I know but that's not actually not a new thing A short squeeze even one of this magnitude should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks Something is just not right I think there is something much much bigger going on here Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system Here is my hypothesis I think the hedge funds clearing houses and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME possibly 100 200 or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop In the process they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now What is that bomb I believe retail investors may hold more than 100 of GME not just 100 of the float more than 100 of the actual company This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system For you to follow this argument you need to go read the white paper Counterfeiting Stock 2 0 so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares They use these fake shares in short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short There is even a term for it strategic fails–to–deliver Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal similar level to counterfeiting money but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME It's not just about a short squeeze it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100 of shares in existence There are are 71 million shares of GME that have ever been issued by the company Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than 102 000 000 shares including the 13 of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen Now I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100 of GME is owned by these firms if not more Moreover there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50 Some of us are even holding thousands If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5 10 we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber that puts the minimum retail position at about 30 50 of the entire company GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month We don't have January data yet but I just analyzed the data from the SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December all 65 871 lines of it and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit For comparison I did the same for a couple random tickers Most companies have close to no shares not show up Of those that do it's a relatively small number of shares For example two random companies Lowes $LOW $125B market cap had 13 960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month Boston Beer Company $SAM $11 5B market cap had 295 shares fail to be delivered How many shares of GME failed to deliver 1 787 191 As the white papers points out the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January I'm willing to bet its many times that Look at how that compares to other companies' stock Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December x axis vs the number of companies that fall into that bin y axis GME is an extreme outlier I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC the clearing houses and the hedge funds are all in on it That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares No real shares can be found and it's about to cause the system to fall apart TLDR We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result Disclaimer I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance I have no inside knowledge of how the financial system works and I may be wrong on some of this This is not financial advice and you shouldn't trade based on it I am book smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you Obligatory rocket 🚀 x200B EDIT 0 Looks like I truly belong on this sub On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution My numbers were wrong but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers EDIT 1 You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers not the entire NYSE I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though EDIT 2 Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares report Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME EDIT 3 A lot of people were hung up on the 3 shares per wsb subscriber thing I know many accounts are bots I was intentionally underestimating that number I have adjusted to 10 shares per legit subscriber to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns EDIT 4 What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system We're not going to go back to mud huts people This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems possibly bankrupting some of them Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again EDIT 5 Backup link for white paper EDIT 6 I am getting thousands of messages I won't be able to respond to all of them Here is an FAQ 1 How do I learn investing I am not an authority on this but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks Read the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham for this Then learn how to think about picking stocks I like Peter Lynch's books for this 2 What is going to happen this week I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess 3 Are you going to be killed I don't know where people are getting this idea I have no special knowledge or insider contacts and I am in no way shape or form an expert on the market or the system behind it Please treat my tinfoil hat conspiracy theories as just that There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to take down the shorts or anything like that I do not advocate for you to buy hold or sell I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place ,2021-01-31

imagine two weeks ago a crusade was brewing that several million traders would soon band together to fire one big shot across the bow of some the most powerful entities in the world How could you have And yet here we stand in the early acts of an epic with Hollywood fighting to tell a story that has barely begun Community Wallstreetbets has not and will never be just one individual rather a collective of ideals and goals greater than the sum of its parts Reddit is the soapbox that allows these diverse individuals to amplify messages that resonate with them with their votes That does not mean this is political Wallstreetbets has never and will never be political The financial system has always been shrouded in mystery and complexity on purpose to keep the golden goose beneficiaries entrenched We’ve especially seen it in action the last few weeks where fairness and the now apparently idealistic thoughts of a level playing field have gone out the window as traders’ control of their own investments was wrested from them We see the users we see the quality of the content and we’re here to evangelize on your behalf The struggle will be long and arduous But we’re in it if you’re in it with us Let’s get it done you amazing degenerates With that a couple of our moderators have shared their personal thoughts on Wallstreetbets and the world we find ourselves in at this juncture Thoughts from /u/zjz For a long time retail traders have been crabs in a bucket Working alone with slow and limited data crappy tools bad execution and worse advice We used to be stuck listening almost solely to pre approved narratives from people who already made it and wanted us to hold the bag We used to be a bunch of duck sized horses I don't think this is a continuation of OWS This isn't really political For our newfriends WSB was never political It isn't solely a battle between the rich and the poor and it's not an attack on the system It's just the next step for retail and it's obviously scary to someone We don't need to occupy anything this subreddit and communities like it are soon to be the 1 000lbs gorilla in the room and we're just not quite sure how to stand yet Retail money has always loomed large it's just never had so much information and made most of its own decisions before It was mis lead by hack analysts and at best had to huddle in index funds for safety When we come together on platforms like this with similar goals similar tools and similar data we become a force that can even without any centralization coordination or deep pockets easily destroy well funded opponents and cause them to have to break the rules just to stay alive Random people that have never spoken before buying GME for reasons ranging from haha brrr to 30 page writeups can cause spikes that can nearly bankrupt the kind of people that aren't used to being the ones on the losing end They're used to being the only ones with a big stick This is only going to accelerate unless the other actors in this space rig the game in their favor even further or trick us into destroying the means by which we can sit at the table You notice how many circuit breakers there were on the way up vs the way down Don't accept anything that limits our access to equities options futures etc Raise hell if they try In order to function we need to figure out how to cram as many monkeys on as many typewriters as possible We need to figure out how to make sure the whole sub sees what those monkeys write we need to filter noise from signal via millions of self interested actors We need to figure out how we can avoid being outmaneuvered by people who will not play fair We've got problems to solve and there will be growing pains but we've all got a chance to be part of something that hasn't existed before Something between a fund a social network a union and an API Work with us on improving this place and getting settled into this mode of operation instead of breaking into pieces They'd love that Apes apart weak Nobody should blame you if you love the stock or sold the stock You should be here to make money There will be a next time and a time after that They can only cheat so many times before it catches up with them they only have so many brains on the task and we're only getting bigger Thoughts from /u/wallstreetboyfriend If you’re still reading thank you I’m last because I’m least important If you only skimmed the above content fuck you Go back and read it Please give all of our mods a shout out and remember to do your part by following our subreddit rules As a reminder We’re all volunteers and we do NOT accept donations We appreciate the sentiment in wanting to donate to us but it would be great if you donated to a charity in our name instead Check out if you want suggestions I’ve been here since the sub was 2000 members It really didn’t hit me on how crazy everything was getting until I checked Twitter last week Regardless of our personal political views let’s marvel at the fact that Ted Cruz AOC Trump Jr Chamath Musk Cuban and countless others from various backgrounds and viewpoints agree so strongly on a single topic We’ve had everything from fractional share owners to multi millionaires band together because they like a stock We’ve been in the news cycles nonstop and there’s even tendies commercials Memes aside things have been shitty for individual traders Recent events have highlighted how skewed the game has been towards institutional traders Whether or not there was any intentional wrongdoing the inherent biases for a hedge fund being bailed out by another hedge fund and ALSO being a major contributor to a large portion of a brokerage’s earnings is kinda fucked up While I’m not smart enough to say whether the game is 100 rigged it certainly doesn’t look good The US government breaks up monopolies for this very reason don’t they The institutional investors claim we don’t know what we’re doing I’m just an artist myself but there are a ton of you here old and new who are well educated and actually do proper DD Despite that hedge funds continued to freely trade while retail traders were locked out We’re showing them we can make decisions with our own finances but institutions don’t like that They enact laws and force emergency actions to “protect” us when the reality is that it limits our ability to compete fairly Can someone explain to me how Pattern Day Trading protects the retail investor Can someone explain to me why an individual must have $1m in assets to be an accredited investor There’s an opportunity in front of us We have a chance to make a difference and maybe level the playing field There are government hearings on Feb 18th and we have politicians from ALL sides offering to look into what happened We even have billionaires like Mark Cuban and the Winklevoss Twins speaking out against this unfairness Regardless of what happens I’m just thankful that I got to be here from the start Our jungle may be bigger but it’s been the same bananas the whole time So what now We have an opportunity to change the game We need to move away from a system with power in the hands of the few to one where power is in the hands of the many The alternative is that we stay where we are now where the fate of retail traders is at the whim of archaic institutions Where they can arbitrarily halt stocks and shackle the free market Why can I Cashapp someone for feet pics in seconds but it takes TWO WHOLE DAYS for shares to be delivered from the DTCC Why do they also get to choose what the deposit requirements are Something needs to change and I’m certain we’re not limited by the technology We’re limited by the people ,2021-02-03 12:00:26,2.

GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,57106,le235t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/,5051,1612660942.0,GME Institutions Hold 177 of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze DISCLAIMER This post is NOT Financial Advice This is actual DD of just statistical cold hard facts My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings Institutions currently hold 177 of the float How is this even possible to own more than 100 of the float Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million In a shorting transaction institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A then sells them to Institution C If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares 20 5 —or 125 25 ÷ 20 In this case institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100 In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100 actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high While somewhat imprecise arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling 1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves data from 9/30/20 but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying are we really going to just let this happen What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately especially when order flows go directly through Citadel But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts This is options expiring 3/12/21 and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest those who write options aka theta gang for price to gravitate towards max pain as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses And right now we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above Thank you for taking your time to read my DD my original post on wsb was removed by the mods MODS please don't delete This is actual DD of just statistical cold hard facts My previous post got deleted if this one does too spread the word Edit This post was removed then reinstated and I am now banned unable to comment and post to this subreddit Edit 2 hi u/OPINION IS UNPOPULAR I would comment and post but I am literally unable to on this subreddit Edit 3 I'm unbanned ,2021-02-07 03:22:22,"8. {""GME"": NULL}"

I feel like clarification is needed about Today,69137,laikd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laikd0/i_feel_like_clarification_is_needed_about_today/,4695,1612253867.0,I feel like clarification is needed about Today There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions Why no spike today First of all we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER They use several tactics to delay it but they can’t circumvent it They’re bleeding and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies It might take just a few days or weeks But eventually when they cover WE retail investors get to set the price That’s why you keep seeing 10k or 69420$ is not a meme Because it’s not We also know they’re down BAD Why Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so So let’s see what tactics they are using Short ladder attacks What is a short ladder attack The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves There is little to no volume on those trades and since no one can buy it looks like the stock is plummeting It’s only effective if we would sell Just look at the volume People are not selling Infiltrating WSB and other social media Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD Obvious shills There’s tons of them Always new or old accounts that suddenly post again All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell Manipulating the Media Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market SEC if you read this Now let’s get some clarification on SILVER There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver People don’t seem to realize 3 things 1 Silver is not a get rich quick move Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move GME is a risky short term play So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today YOLO 2 The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make 3 The hedge funds would love for you to go all in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media SLV inverting GME The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins IF you want to go into silver for whatever reason buy physical But that’s just my retard opinion SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“ You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not and never was about starting crazy short squeezes GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME Silver squeeze not happening links Well Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly Short Version The short version is that a review of the 'strategic fails–to–deliver' data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday There are are 71 million shares of GME that have ever been issued by the company Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than 102 000 000 shares including the 13 of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen That is already 30 000 000 shares more than even exist On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions retail investors may currently hold 50 million shares counting both long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM Once you include call options retail investors may already hold more than 100 of GME not just 100 of the float more than 100 of the actual company This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system Long version here At these levels it’s NOT about the price it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession That’s why they want you to sell so bad 🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎 Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there To the Moon or zero 🦍🦍🦍 APES STRONG TOGETHER 🦍🦍🦍 Disclaimer This is not financial advice I’m literally an ape I just like the stock Do your own DD and avoid the fake new and/or resurrected accounts here and

Open Letter to Melvin Capital CNBC Boomers and WSB Mods do not delete this is important to me please read x200B I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life and the lives of those close to me I was fortunate my parents were prudent and a little paranoid and they had some food storage saved up When that crisis hit our family we were able to keep our little house but we lived off of pancake mix and powdered milk and beans and rice for a year Ever since then my parents have kept a food storage and they keep it updated and fresh Those close to me my friends and extended family were not nearly as fortunate My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like My friends got to find out Almost a year after the crisis' low my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work One of them built a new closet in our guest room Another one did some landscaping in our backyard I will forever be so proud of my parents because in a time of need even when I have no doubt money was still tight they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it To Melvin Capital you stand for everything that I hated during that time You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished And your blatant disregard for the law made obvious months ago through your for the Melvin lawyers out there alleged illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08 And why would you Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions I bought shares a few days ago I dumped my savings into GME paid my rent for this month with my credit card and dumped my rent money into more GME which for the people here at WSB I would not recommend And I'm holding This is personal for me and millions of others You can drop the price of GME after hours $120 I'm not going anywhere You can pay for thousands of reddit bots I'm holding You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us I don't care I'm making this as painful as I can for you To CNBC you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that short term Your staple audience will soon become too old to care and the millions of us not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us and tried to tear down the little guys I know for sure I'll remember this In response here is a list of CNBC sponsors and partners They include but are not limited to IBM Cisco TMobile JPMorgan Oracle and ZipRecruiter Their parent company is NBCUniversal owned by Comcast and GE To the boomers and/or people close to that age just now paying attention to these millennial blog posts you realize that even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were We're not enemies we're on the same side Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers and start rooting for us because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago and we're taking that opportunity Your children your grandchildren might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against You really want to choose them over your own family and friends We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet We're just asking you to be understanding supportive and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago To WSB you all are amazing I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash Whether you're here for the gains to stick it to the man as I am or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement thank you Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance I've never felt this optimistic about the future before This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible I love you all x200B x200B Note I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that

Why the $GME MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) is real and why it is scary for the rest of the market,25631,m79wdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/,4332,1616041930.0,Why the $GME MOASS Mother of All Short Squeezes is real and why it is scary for the rest of the market So I tried to post this on r/investing and r/stocks but I don't think I meet their karma requirements so I am gonna start this post here This post is gonna be long and in order to understand it you need to understand how market makers works If you don’t understand that concept that’s fine A simple google search will yield sources better than me that can provide you a basic understanding of market makers and short selling So try doing a quick search to educate yourself then come back here The GME market wide Correlation So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market Hence when the market has major red days across multiple sectors GME is still green among a sea of red And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation When you align charts of GME since December with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq it’s like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest So why is this happening Well the simplified explanation is this When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions like Melvin capital for example it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called So for example when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position This is pretty basic stuff But this isn’t a normal Short Squeeze The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets was the fact that GME’s short percentage reached a height of 140 But what does a 140 float mean Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed Well yes that’s called naked shorting but it’s more complicated than that How Naked Shorts work When a naked short is created it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower So when you see 140 short percentage that doesn’t mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting it means when these institutions Melvin heavily shorted GME the Market Makers Citadel created shares out of thin air and tethered them to the real shares that were borrowed These made up shares are synthetic shares they don’t actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing sorry I don’t have a time stamp but today’s hearing is worth watching if you have the time The Big Short So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to “Synthetic CDO’s” from the 2008 crisis I’m using synthetic CDO’s as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie “The Big Short ” These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO’s So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money Now to talk about the current squeeze It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with Infinite risk This is how short squeezes happen if the price is driven up the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender which then further increases the price of a share and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post at $215/share but it’s price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up But here is the the important part The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the synthetic shares only become “real” when the short position completely closes or is margin called This means the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number So you don’t need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous once the synthetic shares come to fruition We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money But that doesn’t stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares So The MM’s are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb Now why it’s scary for the rest of the market So if you’ve been following to this point you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation I don’t think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in this short position So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs I’m talking in the billions of dollars across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee and I don’t think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost I believe with great conviction when GME truly takes off it will cause a major market wide correction across all sectors The Conclusion Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because the way these contract expiry dates are usually set the number of option contracts set around those dates And It’s possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time However I can say 2 things with absolute certainty We are witnessing history this whole thing is already resulting in many academic studies further government intervention and future movies/documentaries There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again I do not care what broker you have fidelity E TRADE Schwab or robinhood etc They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys and very possibly sells just like RH did on January 28th When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January THIS WILL NOT BE THE BROKERS FAULT THE MARKET MAKERS AND HEDGE FUNDS SHOULD BE THE ONES FOOTING THE BILL EVEN IF THAT MEANS SELLING OFF EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THEIR BUILDING TO DO SO Mainstream Brokers only have so much money to provide the liquidity needed to move billions of trades a day they are not equipped to deal with something this insane So Why did I type up this long ass post If you think I’m just a crazy person that’s fine I don’t take it personally I’m just making this post because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders I know GME is a “meme stock” so it’s easy to discredit and it’s fun watching this David vs Goliath story but I believe this will have very real effects across the whole market so proceed with caution on your trades until this squeeze reaches a conclusion ESPECIALLY IF YOU DEAL WITH NAKED OPTIONS If you read this whole thing thanks Please let me know if there is any corrections I should make TLDR just skim the bold points ya lazy fuck lol Edit gonna have to turn off notifications now lol So I’m sorry if I don’t reply maybe later But most importantly I’m no professional I’m just a guy with an interest in the world of finance So don’t take this post as gospel I wanted to start this thread for the discussion and while I do strongly personally believe the MOASS is real I appreciated the counter points Thanks for the laughs and genuine discussion,2021-03-18 06:32:10,"3. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

short 2 0 I have translated his message into a language you autists may with effort be able to understand Three words Inflation Our father Autist Michael Burry Burry if you read that don't be offended we mean it as a term of endearment You are our hero Has called the next crisis He posted a book on twitter that I will link here I have just finished reading the book The dying of money Here I will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh I read the book so you didn't have to x200B Unfortunately I need to first explain some simple economics but here goes Most of you already know many of this stuff you can skip a bit ahead This first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited x200B In order to stimulate the economy America and other governments by way of their Central banks ‘print money’ They do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market They sometimes as during the COVID crisis buy corporate debt too They actually literally ‘buy’ this money with money they ‘digitally print’ That money comes from nowhere They add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom printed money Their intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates When you buy a bond you push it’s price up which then decreases it’s yield – if that relationship confuses you here is an example A 1 year bond is trading in the market at 98$ this bond has a par value of 100$ so you can buy the bond at 98$ wait a year and receive 100$ A nice 2/98 2 yield Below fed buys bonds yields go lower x200B Yields fall as government buys bonds If interest rates go down businesses borrow more money to invest and jobs are created because investments create jobs But if an economy is running at 2 interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 2 5 would be invested in because they can earn the difference 0 5 Why doesn’t the printing of money by way of decreasing interest rates cause inflation immediately Well actually it does It creates inflation immediately in stock prices The ‘printed’ money doesn’t go to your average citizen it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the Central Bank It goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the Central Bank because they can earn more in stocks this way They are clever they know a stock yielding even a stable 3 will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2 x200B x200B Stonks go up when fed prints Relationship is dumb simple x200B START READING HERE SMART AUTISTS When does printing become a problem The central bank looks at food prices general household items petrol prices housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week Bundle these together and call them CPI Consumer price index – inflation Inflation in certain goods Now let’s imagine a scenario You have 100 people in an economy 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don’t have much extra to invest or save each month They use their savings to purchase mediocre goods a new bicycle or a new TV Why would they invest that extra $100 it’s too little a sum to have any affect even in the long run on their lives Now we look at the rich they already have the TV the car a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses Where does their extra savings go Straight into stocks And maybe a new car every so often Fine dining and other sorts of things which are not in the CPI consumer price index basket x200B WATCH THIS Mr Central banker comes along and prints an extra $1000 Give this money to the Rich man what will he do He already has the car he already has the houses He will invest it straight into the market Bam Stock market inflation stock market goes up This is what has been happening since 2008 you will see a graph further below that displays this process The extra 1000$ does not affect the CPI basket…The rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more TV’s The “stimulus” money from the Central bank inflates only the stock market Give this 1000$ to the poor normal man what will he do He may treat his wife to dinner buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn’t afford Fill up his truck Pay his rent It is not that he is wrong to do this this is most likely his best option A meagre 1000$ in the stock market will have no effect on his life even in the long term The point here is that Central Bank ‘Printing’ does cause inflation it causes inflation immediately in the stock market because that’s where the money goes Only when that money ‘spills’ into public hands Think stimulus checks does inflation in the ‘CPI’ sense of the word unveil itself Inflation becomes a problem Inflation becomes a problem when it isn’t accompanied by its good friend economic growth Inflation has an interesting effect of raising bond yields Investors don’t want 2 bond yield if inflation is at 3 So they simple do this they don’t buy bonds What happens when someone doesn’t want to buy your house You lower the price No one is buying bonds Bond prices go lower and therefore yields rise – Remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98$ to 95$ supply demand At the end of the bond’s life you get 100$ so the yield rises as the price falls The inflation problem occurs when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money The poor man was able to effect CPI because he will actually purchase goods in the CPI basket Give every poor man in America 1000$ they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods A limited supply of goods supply demand and prices rise Inflation – CPI x200B What do we do There are basically only two outcomes to this scenario 1 If inflation in CPI caused by the average American’s stimulus check opening of the economy increasing oil and commodity prices gathers momentum it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of America Everyone who holds dollars or dollar denominated debt – meaning every single country Will pay for America’s inflationary sins Fortunately poorer countries who are indebted to America should actually benefit from this Under this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much look at red line in graph x200B x200B The red gap is the inflationary potential The inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventually You can see that in 2008 the Central government began its shenanigans In a stable economy money supply should increase sort of in line with GDP As you can see above money supply has increased far more than that That gap indicated by the red line is inflationary potential It now basically just sits in stocks Under this scenario by my calculations money supply needs to come back down to real GDP The Central Bank won’t do this They won’t tighten That would hurt too much But the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them And prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply 2 Scenario 2 A highly probable outcome Japanification Japan has been doing QE for a much longer time than America The reason why they haven’t blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor So that inflation couldn’t occur in CPI However inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were As it was them who had more access to this money America’s Central Bank could by way of printing even more money buy more bonds and push down yields They could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn’t gain momentum If inflation gains real momentum which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes then they cannot follow Japans lead If inflation remains muted and low The real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen x200B It is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct QE which disproportionately benefits the rich It may just be the only way they know And by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins x200B What happens in scenario 1 summary Inflation goes out of control CPI inflation stock inflation has already had its turn Yields rise Central Bank get’s spooked and tries to raise rates a little Economy tanks due to raised rates 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70 relative to the price of real goods not relative to the price of other currencies Or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the system highly unlikely Stocks fall because yields rose And everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market x200B What happens in scenario 2 summary Inflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks Central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum If inflation does not gain momentum the Central Bank will continue to print until they see GDP growth Stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place This could take 10 years or 100 years x200B x200B Inflation only becomes a problem when the poor get to buy normal goods that exist in the CPI x200B TL DR You don't deserve to benefit in this crash It is a well known secret that the real autists on this forum can read and read well x200B One more thing Warren Buffett and Michael Burry both filed their 13 F recently They are holding a LOT of inflation hedged stocks Telecommunications real estate consumer goods x200B The book he posted Read it it's bloody enlightening May even cure your autism I see you dudes like this post I'll write more here ,2021-02-24 19:18:44,"2. {""NULL""}"

"Why GameStop was going to cause a collapse of the entire market, and why it is still going to:",20830,lnvvu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/,3955,1613813357.0,Why GameStop was going to cause a collapse of the entire market and why it is still going to Disclaimer This is not financial advice and much of this information is not my own sourced from other DD’s many that have been removed As many of you know on the 17th of this month Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview Automod won't let me link it where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze However this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined Tom or should we go with Tommy goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse let’s play his game and ponder this idea for a second Tom states without the regulation brokers would have been obligated to deliver 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed 540 of shares Vlad CEO of RobinHood also told us that on the day of the halt they had an order volume of 3 Billion that they could not fulfill Tom continues the interview admitting that without the regulation GameStop stock would have surged into the thousands yes plural Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is Finra’s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78 46 However there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed For one Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest letting the synthetic longs drive this down Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up to date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now So what is the true short interest then Well let’s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024 Insider Ownership 23 704 787 Institutions 151 000 000 Funds 40 000 000 Retail 38 595 000 Total Owned 253 299 787 Total Outstanding 69 746 960 Percentage of ownership to outstanding 363 17 Estimated Synthetic Shares 183 552 827 FINRA Short of Float 78 46 Finviz Float 50 650 000 Reported Shares Shorted 35 538 624 Total Estimated Short Synthetic Reported 219 091 451 Percentage of Shorts to the Float 432 56 If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024’s data check out his DD But yes the short interest may be a whopping 432 56 Last week u/thabat ran an AI generated model of GME’s stock price which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme $130k a share Now I know lol Let’s not get ahead of ourselves That is a completely crazy fucking number I mean right It has to be But I mean if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world If SI really is 400 shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights If this is what our models show imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have This may very well be why they are so frightened They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us Without regulation this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes So now alongside our Dogfather Cohen we shall wait patiently for a catalyst Just like on the last squeeze to $483 we required a catalyst to get us there Don’t forget the information we knew in November and December Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of Cohen could up his stake Earnings in March Who knows what could happen It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world and we are still in its infancy Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not We are basically right back where we were in November/December The stock price does not matter If short interest is at 400 or if short interest is at 80 Both are insanely high SI values and a squeeze is inevitable one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50 000 With high short interest a squeeze is inevitable NEVER forget that So continue to hold fellow apes May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel 💎🙌 Edit Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also admitted that they halted to save themselves Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it WAS NOT a liquidity issue but that is his reasoning now You can find these 2 interviews on youtube AutoMod wont let me link youtube Edit 2 XRT short interest is up 20 this week reaching 199 SI 🤔🤔 more proof of the artificial price drops ,2021-02-20 11:29:17,13.

interested in 1 The silver short squeeze evidence 2 Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS 3 The fundamental case for silver and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed 4 TLDR what to buy if you want to go long silver Since my initial post on the potential for a silver short squeeze I have been researching the topic to prepare a more detailed and substantiated update post This is my latest attempt to post and hopefully this one gets to stay up silver censorship has been a thing here lately 1 The potential for a short squeeze 573 of the 'float' is currently sold short The big thing to remember here is that if enough market participants who are long silver contracts in the futures market begin to demand delivery of their silver there will absolutely be a meltup in the price because there simply isn't enough supply available The next 3 trading days are critical and there is war being waged The shorts and COMEX are in a fight for their lives and barely hanging on by a thread Many big name precious metals veterans have bemoaned for years about how the size of the 'paper' silver market absolutely dwarfs the amount of silver that could be delivered and thus the market is manipulated The vast majority of futures and options contracts in the silver market have historically been settled via cash Meaning no physical silver is actually delivered when these contracts are set to expire This is where the talk of the 100 1 and 250 1 paper silver to physical silver ratios comes from but short interest is actually more like 6 1 on the COMEX using open interest data through the next two big delivery months Technically every month is eligible for deliveries but only months with options interest tend to have any real volume and that's why they are known as delivery months March and May are options expiration months while April is not If you want to think about it like a stock the short interest is 573 of the 'float' This is based on the fact that over the next 3 months there are futures contracts and options which have the right to take delivery of 847 million ounces of silver This is compared to only 147 million ounces registered on the COMEX that could fulfil these deliveries For perspective GME short interest peaked at around 140 of its float and that was considered crazy high It is widely known that if a small but significant share of long silver contract holders took delivery that there would not be enough silver as the demand would cascade higher and higher as the prices rise sources silver stocks report futures open interest options open interest data as of 2 18 was used in this post This would be similar to a bank run scenario The COMEX is the silver bank and they have printed too many paper claims on a limited amount of silver If there is no actual silver left to be delivered to the holders of the futures contracts that means that means that the COMEX would default and settle their contracts in cash No one wants to get settled in cash if the COMEX had to default This would mean that right as you want to be able to stay long silver as the price is surging higher that you will get forced out and paid cash instead of silver and wouldn't benefit from future increases in the price The traders who want to stay long silver and who see the run occurring would try to take delivery because if you actually have physical silver in your vault then it doesn't matter if the COMEX goes down you still have your actual silver you can sell on the spot market Most importantly to them they get to keep participating in the upside Now the shorts are very much trying to keep the price down at the moment because their problems get worse as the price rises and more options become in the money See the chart below with a handy arrow to illustrate where we are currently in terms of March open interest As the price rises more and more the short interest grows as more options on futures contracts become 'in the money' compounding problems for the shorts This is the silver version of a gamma squeeze The chart below shows the number of ounces that would be eligible for delivery over the next 3 months given the current open interest data Most of the open interest comes from futures contracts that aren't dependent on price but I've made this chart to illustrate how the problems get worse for the shorts due to the options contracts as the price rises The latest silver price as I'm writing this is $27 37 x200B But why would contract holders all of a sudden start to demand delivery when cash settlement has historically been the norm A couple of reasons The first reason is arbitrage Premiums on 1000oz bars have surged to somewhere between $1 and $2 an ounce this is unheard of on the 1000oz commercial bars meaning that traders can stand for delivery and then sell in the physical market for immediate profit When supply had become constrained in previous silver bull markets these premiums were more like 30 cents an ounce In addition mints are also interested in arbitrage They could begin to take delivery to break down 1000oz commercial bars into smaller units which currently trade at historic premiums of $5 $8 an ounce The small unit silver market has experienced greater demand than ever before The entire stock of small unit silver was sold out at all dealers a few weeks ago The small amounts they do get in stock are only sold at massive premiums The second reason traders may take delivery is because they see the massive opportunity presenting itself right now and they don't want to be cash settled when the COMEX defaults They see that the squeeze is possible and that they profit massively by simply taking delivery sitting on their silver while the squeeze happens and then reselling it at much higher prices Early rumblings of massively increased delivery volume is already presenting itself in the data See the chart below showing the past 3 months of deliveries compared with the same time period in previous years x200B Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise Note that this chart corresponds with December of the previous year through February of the year that is labeled on the x axis So 2016 actually represents December of 2015 through February of 2016 It seems that the silver futures market is suddenly becoming a place where silver actually gets delivered in meaningful quantities This trend is even more pronounced when you look at just the most recent month of February which like April was not an options expiration month and thus typically has very low volume Even still the increased interest in taking delivery of silver from the COMEX is very clear And historic at that x200B Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise February 2021 has had 9 95 million ounces delivered through 2 18 and there is still 1 83 million ounces in open interest Anyone still sitting in a contract this late in the month wants delivery so we can safely assume Feb deliveries will end above 11 million and closer to 12 million This is compared with an average of only 2 20 million ounces delivered in the previous 3 Februaries An increase of roughly 422 assuming 11 5 million delivered March is gearing up to potentially be an earth shattering month for delivery requests that could send silver soaring March in the previous 3 years has averaged 26 79 million ounces delivered If this year's month of March experienced the same 422 increase in deliveries that occurred in February that would represent 140 million ounces delivered Enough to completely drain the COMEX registered stocks If typical contract roll forward behavior persists we are actually on track to hit around that number The chart below shows how March is on track to finish the month with between 30 40k contracts demanding delivery each contract represents 5 000 oz Chart is courtesy of u/Ditch the DeepState who does an awesome job with these x200B Edit 2/20 u/Ditch the DeepState added a zoomed in version in his latest post so I thought I'd add it here because it just looks so nice x200B note this has one more day of data relative to the chart above The final day to roll contracts forward to not be eligible for March delivery is Wednesday February 24th Given these are not normal times in terms of deliveries it would not surprise me to see the decline for OI in March flatten out and stun the world by finishing with 40k contracts awaiting delivery The COMEX only has registered stocks to cover 29 4k And let's say the COMEX survives March and is able to meet all the delivery requests this is what the May open interest looks like Can you imagine the COMEX going into May with only 20 or 30 million registered ounces staring down the barrel of 450 million ounces of open interest and this figure will rise once March passes and/or the price rise causes more call options to be ITM At this point the long in May would absolutely stand for delivery and hope they are one of the lucky few who aren't force settled in Cash x200B So even if only half or three fourths of the 147 million available ounces are delivered the May contract holders will see that the available supply is shrinking fast creating even more demand for physical delivery because the opportunity is that much more clear for a continued short squeeze That and the fact that there are longs who really do want the silver for various reasons and would be worried that the COMEX will default and there will be no silver available for delivery at all This is where critics of the potential for a short squeeze may point out that if the COMEX starts to run out of silver they will just find more This is increasingly not an option however The primary stores of 1000oz bars are the LBMA vaults in London and the COMEX When the COMEX starts experiencing high demand for gold or silver deliveries typically due to the existence of premiums between paper and physical and a phenomenon known as backwardation traders start chartering planes to deliver excess metal from the LBMA to the COMEX This occurred in March and April for gold and silver when physical started trading at premiums and traders began to demand delivery x200B The problem with this line of thought is that nearly all of the silver in the LBMA is effectively allocated already The most common silver ETFs such as SLV use the LBMA silver vaults to allocate silver to their ETFs and recent historic inflows to these ETFs has created a situation where the LBMA simply does not have unallocated supply that they will be able to ship to the COMEX Bullionstar com recently ran an article showing that 85 of the silver in the LBMA was now held by silver ETFs that utilize the LBMA stores This means that this Silver cannot be taken from the LBMA to reinforce the registered stocks of the COMEX Also notice how last spring/summer is when LBMA inventory shown in green dropped which aligns with when the silver price surged and increased COMEX deliveries were happening 2020 was a record year for deliveries x200B The LMBA is estimated to contain 1 08 billion ounces of silver Meaning that 162 million ounces aren't already allocated to ETFs Not known though is how much of this 162 million ounces is owned by wealthy individuals and family offices who already have a claim to it Indeed the supply situation at the LBMA is dire enough that the worlds largest silver ETF SLV had to change it's prospectus to mention that they may not be able to find silver to allocate to their ETF in the near future They made this change on 2/3 following historic inflows but didn't make the document public until 2/8 for some reason Nor did they announce the change x200B Another decently sized silver ETF that I can't mention also changed their prospectus and directly mentioned that there might be a short squeeze and actually seems to sympathize with the hedge funds who would potentially be 'hurt' in the process So why did JPM feel the need to downgrade silver just as it started to spike why did the CFTC feel the need to raise margin requirements the very same day and why did Goldman feel the need to publish an article saying the squeeze was impossible also on the same day They are terrified the squeeze of the naked shorts in the silver market might actually happen Just as the ETFs are now warning in their prospectuses The report from Goldman made the ludicrous claim that each member of WSB would need to purchase 4 200 ounces of silver to cause a squeeze Assuming approximately 8 million members at the time that's roughly 33 6 billion ounces of silver and at $27 37 an ounce would represent $920 billion worth of silver There is a myth that the silver market is as large as $1 5 trillion in total which is probably where Jeff Currie from Goldman somehow came up with this $920 billion figure This is a vast overstatement of the available investment grade silver These figures represent the grand total of all silver that has ever been mined in the history of the world The overwhelming majority of this silver has been used in the production of various electronics medical devices and other products and simply cannot be recovered Maybe at $500 an ounce dumps will begin to look for phones and other electronics and try to chemically separate the miniscule amounts of silver from each device but at $27 an ounce this is completely unrealistic Even then it would be a minimum 6 months to get silver recycled from these devices and into the 1000oz bar format that is required for the futures market If you look at various sources google it most of them estimate the entire quantity of investable silver in the world is somewhere between 2 8 and 4 billion ounces if you include the small denominations of silver which can't be used to deliver on the COMEX Using the high end estimate at 4 billion ounces this would mean the entire investment grade silver market is only valued at $109 billion The futures market only deals with 1000oz bars of which there is estimated to only be 2 billion ounces worth There are only 0 36 to 0 52 investment grade ounces of silver per person in the world if you include both the small denominations and the 1000oz bars together At $27 37 an ounce this is only $9 85 to $14 23 worth of investment grade silver per person Go take a stroll through some of the silver forums on reddit and you'll see people are buying 6 figures worth regularly right now The allocated and unallocated silver in the LBMA and COMEX in total is roughly 1 5 billion ounces which is a far cry from the 33 6 billion that Goldman is referring to As I have mentioned most of this 1 5 billion ounces is already allocated to owners as well Think about 2 billion ounces worth of silver in 1000oz format That is a tiny tiny number At current prices it represents $55 billion There are only 2 million 1000oz bars and each one costs roughly $27 710 There is another asset that has been in the news recently that is over 55k in price WSB bans mentioning it I'm not trying to pump it just use it for an example There are only 21 million of these items that will ever be mined and they are valued for their scarcity and deflationary tendency For every ten of these things which shall not be named there is only one 1000oz commercial silver bar and each bar costs roughly half of what 1 of the things that shall not be named costs To say that silver could not have an epic surge in the same way despite being 10x more scarce and half the price at that is ludicrous Silver is used in production of actual real things and the supply over a long enough period will actually be entirely exhausted unless we figure out how to economically mine asteroids which would only be economical at silver prices far beyond what's ever been achieved As part of my research for this post I was actually able to get in touch with silver industry veteran David Morgan thanks for answering a random guy's twitter DM David He told me an anecdote from back in the previous run up during 2010 11 where he had a conversation with Eric Sprott who mentioned that Sprott Inc's purchase of just 22 million commercial ounces to start their ETF of PSLV was enough to drive up the price by over $2 an ounce Unlike the other silver ETFs which just allocate silver off of the LBMA PSLV actually sources silver in the open market to add to their vaults which is why investing in PSLV can actually cause the silver price to rise much more directly than the other ETFs So who is on the other side of this trade Banks and large hedge funds who are massively net short silver to the tune of 91 468 contracts sold short compared with only 16 071 contracts long The banks are trying to make sure the price stays low so that they can discourage run ups in the price that would create a short squeeze and cause them to experience massive losses on their naked short positions If you want more proof that these markets are historically manipulated look at the fines JPM had to pay recently Which brings me to part 2 x200B 2 Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS Several posts have documented the timeline of Silver posts on WSB and why the narrative of hedge funds pushing silver to hurt GME doesn't really make sense Here's a couple of them that I personally liked and there are many more one from u/johnnycleveland and another from u/blipblopbloop11 Besides the fact that many on WSB were fans of silver long before the GME craze including myself banks have a massive net short position in silver which I cover later in this post At the time the anti silver post went viral about Citadel having a large position in SLV it comprised only 0 04 of their AUM and they actually had 3 times this amount 0 13 of AUM in PUTS ON SLV Proof So it doesn't make sense for them to try and stop one short squeeze that hurts them by causing a second short squeeze that would also hurt them I'm not sure if hedge fund bots were actually driving the anti silver propaganda or if it just caught on because people wanted a scapegoat for the GME losses but either way it seems like silver was in the wrong place at the wrong time The people investing in silver and the people investing in GME are natural allies Its a mix of a desire for tendies and giving big banks and hedge funds the finger Why weren't AMC BB NOK weed stocks and many other popular positions not considered distractions from GME Wouldn't GME have gone much higher if everyone on WSB had stuck to only GME and not these other plays There was absolutely institutional collusion to prevent GME from getting the infinity squeeze it was set up to get The interactive brokers CEO even said on live TV that the price was headed to infinity if they hadn't stepped in to stop the losses This collusion is simply unrelated to the fact that some of us on WSB also like the silver market setup I totally agree that media reports of WSB 'moving to silver' were somewhat poorly worded Just as the reports of WSB moving to weed stocks were poorly worded Some people on WSB are playing silver some are playing weed stocks but these headlines make it sound like it's everyone when it's never true that all of WSB is long a single trade GME may have been close though I understand frustration about poor reporting Please don't take it out on your fellow WSB apes though And if you are still holding GME and think it can squeeze again I respect that and I still hope it goes to $1 000 and higher x200B 3 The fundamental case for silver and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed First of all as previously mentioned the short side of the equation is almost entirely made up of banks and hedge funds so keep that in mind when you might have sympathy for the shorts here Second the demonetization of silver was used as a blunt instrument to impoverish the populace and enrich the wealthy and bankers all the way back in 1873 We know that wealth is generational so if you had family living in the United States prior to 1873 and they were not wealthy it is highly likely that they were massively impoverished by banker related corruption at the time Here's a quick rundown of what happened Originally both gold and silver were considered legal tender in the United States The monetary base was roughly half comprised of gold and half comprised of silver with a fixed exchange rate of 15 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold Because silver was more common it was considered the common currency of exchange with gold only being used by the wealthy in large transactions In 1873 a bill was signed to demonetize silver while keeping gold as legal tender All of the common people had their savings in silver which became increasingly worth less relative to gold while all of the wealthy had their savings in gold so the value of their savings appreciated In line with the removal of 50 of the monetary base we experienced roughly 50 deflation over the next few decades x200B Along with this deflation though the value of debt also rose So if you were poor and also likely indebted with one stroke of a pen your money began to become worthless while at the same time your debt became progressively worth more due to deflation If you were a wealthy gold owner or a bank you likely owned that debt that became worth more alongside the gold you already held A double win for the wealthy and a double hit for the poor One stroke of a pen created generational wealth for some and generational poverty for others Yet another reason squeezing silver with banks on the other side of the trade would be true cosmic justice Fundamentally there are plenty of reasons why silver demand long term will rise On the industrial demand side silver is used in solar panels electric vehicles other electronics of all kinds and expensive space related items where getting 100 electricity conduction is worth it compared with the second best metal of copper at 97 These industries are expected to grow quickly in the next decade and more silver will be needed for this reason Monetarily the money supply is expanding at historic rates and most of the 'smartest people in the room' are calling for higher inflation in the next few years Pretty much every commodity except gold and silver have been on an absolute tear the last few months and they are breaking out into what most consider multi year bull market cycles This will drive inflation even further Silver is more common than gold but spread rather thin in the earth's crust so it isn't mined directly in large quantities It's more typically a byproduct of mining for other raw materials The lack of dedicated silver mines means that silver today is mined at only an 8 1 ratio to gold despite naturally occurring at roughly 18 75 1 ratio Silver is currently trading at a 66 1 ratio to gold and gold hasn't even been rising lately In the 2010 2011 run we got down to a 30 1 ratio and if people begin to worry about inflation and consider silver a monetary hedge there's nothing stopping silver from getting to its natural ratio of 18 75 1 or even lower considering the industrial demand combined with the lower 8 1 production ratio These lower ratios combined with higher gold prices in the future mean that silver can realistically get above $50 in short order possibly even above $100 and if you think the monetary system is really headed downhill even up to the outrageous forecasts of $500 from the likes of Patrick Karim on twitter Note that Patrick posts various charts all the time and his most recent forecast is $182 silver by 2023 Love your charts Patrick give this man a follow In terms of timing this thing look at the only other 3 times silver went into backwardation in the past decade we've just entered the 4th time Every single time it had a powerful rally afterwards because it means that physical supply is constrained in the short run and the shorts are trying to pay longs to get out of their contracts And those other 3 times didn't have a true chance of COMEX default like this time does supply/demand has never been this imbalanced and the premiums in the physical market are proof of that x200B In the end the goal of buying silver should be to make tendies and to end the manipulation of these markets We need to get to the point where entering into a contract to sell silver means you actually have the physical silver to sell No more naked shorting and profiteering off the little people An honest silver market is the ultimate goal here x200B 4 TLDR what to buy To get the most secure best value for your dollar in terms of silver I would personally prioritize purchases in the following order others may prioritize differently and that's ok 1 Take delivery on the futures market if you are able no premiums but only available to large players 2 Purchase shares of the PSLV ETF who will then purchase 1000oz bars 3 Purchase 1000oz bars at retail if you can find them for reasonable premiums 4 Purchase smaller units of silver if the premiums come down to 15 or less There are roughly 1 2 billion ounces of small unit silver in the world that don't directly impact the 1000oz bar market but demand for them does cause premiums to soar which can then cause mints to purchase 1000oz bars to smelt into smaller pieces This is also the preferred option for those who are concerned with the total collapse of the fiat monetary system and other doomsday scenarios Personally I'm just wanting honest markets and to make tendies which is why this ranks 4th on my list 5 Purchase other silver ETFs such as SLV Purchasing these will at least theoretically take silver off of the LBMA but recent disclosures from these ETFs are making them seem less trustworthy note that there is no definitive proof of any kind of fraud from these ETFs 6 Riskier Alternatives Purchasing shares of silver miners calls on silver miners and even calls on the other silver ETFs are all riskier bets and potentially more profitable short term This is likely what many here at WSB are going to do Disclosure I am long silver miners and silver ETFs at this time Also disclosure make your own choices we are all individuals this is my personal take on the silver market and it includes plenty of speculation and opinion Treat this post as just that some random guy's opinion on the internet x200B Update To the people saying this 'looks fishy' because of the comment to upvote ratio or award to upvote ratio its only that way because of the people exactly like yourself who auto downvote anything related to silver and really anything not GME If this post had the same upvote ratio as my original post 3 weeks ago I'd legitimately have 5 10x the upvotes right now And this post is far better and more deserving than my original one was Its a self fulfilling prophecy over here where a noob sees a non GME post downvotes it without reading OG WSBers see a well thought out DD and give upvotes and awards then more cultists come along and say it looks fishy Try reading the post first You know what is super fishy The fact that the WSB mod coup attempt occurred right when the anti silver propaganda blew up and silver posts were banned after that as well Ask yourself who was in charge when silver censorship started and you'll realize what is actually fishy here x200B ,2021-02-20 14:42:16,
SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,34274,lbaktb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/,3593,1612339673.0,SOBER REVIEW TIME what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today Edit There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go or make a followup tomorrow First off my position 1900 shares of GME 30 plus 5 calls $250 Peak value was nearly 500k This is not financial advice I'm not an expert etc WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity and sticking it to the man and 'fuck it I'm down so much anyway' NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold Here's our biggest problem Misinformation There is a lot of information being spread around like manure Mostly unread mostly un disseminated basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now That is what I intend to review and hopefully gather from you apes here today A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME 1 Fundamental Value This isn't relevant right now GME is presently a $20/share company even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model When that happens the value will go up for now 30 above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture 2 Momentum This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share and the biggest reason we're still at $90 way above fundamental value Here's something to consider Momentum not the squeeze is why the share price is where it is rather the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard But people are also idiots Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure and can be easily manipulated as we've seen 3 THE SHORT SQUEEZE What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices Short sellers who are actually not theoretically pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss and en masse If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called If/when they exited they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest to the point that they were straight up given a multi billion dollar bailout by their competitors These people don't play by the same rules as you you fucking braindead monkey 4 The Gamma Squeeze Last Friday for the second Friday in a row a vast majority of calls expired In The Money and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today T 2 rule The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough and so didn't actually own enough underlying shares to hand over and now need to rush to buy them at market price Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon Maybe But a gamma squeeze can also backfire All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy or the margin to borrow That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace 5 Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh best believe it happened and is still happening Just to review the hits 1 DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere 2 Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling 3 A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver 4 Retail brokers cancelling orders restricting limit prices enforcing unwanted stop losses eToro 5 Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands x200B OK BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY x200B No really I'm asking Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information I will edit and update this list as information is shared Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can Argument 1 The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high Claim As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float there is a supply problem for short sellers This may translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time driving the squeeze Evidence needed What is the current short interest S3 partners provides estimates using a model and as of today claim it is only 51 of free float Source x200B Ortex data provides another estimate using another model and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares only a million shares difference from S3Source x200B REAL DATA The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month The most recent data we have is from Jan 15 and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27 On Jan 15 the SI was 131 The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9 Frankly we can't rely on the REAL data because it's delayed too long to be relevant Evidence needed What is the actual free float I still need help finding this I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days If 27 million shorts still need to close how many shares are readily available Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46 89 mil shares FWIWSource Argument 2 There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close Claim assuming 27 mil shorted not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions Evidence Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today Date Trade Volume 2/2 Tue 77 8m 2/1 Mon 37 3m 1/29 Fri 50 5m 1/28 Thu 58 5m 1/27 Wed 93 3m Argument 3 Short Sellers will are under pressure to close so the squeeze is coming Claim Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions and will eventually prefer or be forced to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze Evidence needed Shorts are on average in a losing position at current share price $90 and can't just close right now at profit Evidence needed Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further x200B Argument 4 Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work and retailers didn't sell off en masse creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply Claim Price dips happened during low volume trading short ladder market manipulation etc and the longs are holding fast Counterevidence THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS Evidence This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio Source Counterargument Order counts don't mean shit For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller So 100k buyers buy one share each and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each and there are less buyers than sellers overall WHO KNOWS This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders Evidence needed Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold Evidence needed other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders Fidelity is just one broker and a retail broker at that Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity x200B Argument 5 The biggest dips were driven by short ladder attacks during low volume periods Claim the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling short ladders and not so much by change in momentum Evidence At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors Essentially round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices Counterargument short ladder attacks are straight up not real conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself Evidence needed I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts 100 shares at a time could use that Counterargument The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker Damage to momentum was done but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip right Evidence needed That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by

"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)",40258,ldjbg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/,3571,1612593568.0,Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday Why They Didn't Cover on Friday and Why They Want You to Think They Did GME Fellow Apes I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such I know you guys can't read but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this 🚀🚀🚀 Part 1 What Happened on the 28th As we all know last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze This is a significant day because it broke momentum and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis Here is a tweet from Ihor S3 stating the short interest data as of the 28th Per S3 Short Interest was 62 9M as of the 27th and 57 8M as of the 28th The net SI is 57 8M 62 9M 5 08M This means the net short position reduced by 5 08M shares however many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down Well lets say that's what happened and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly We will also assume this happened in a vacuum i e retail did not contribute to any volume so that we can get a liberal estimate To establish a short position at a higher price hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482 85 If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling than they would have opened 15 8M more short positions 10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350 and the remaining 5 8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480 This means that if shorts added to their position at this time the best they could have done is add 15 8M short positions at an average $300 This is assuming no covering was done during this period of time which is highly unlikely considering the price went up Now during the freefall following RH trade restrictions there was only 10 4M in volume If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price they would have only been able to cover 10 4M positions and 5 7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300 only 4 7M could have been between $300 and $112 This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time and it doesn't even account for that fact that covering would drive the price up not down Lastly after the nosedive there was a bounce of 9 2M in volume If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average they would only be able to add 9 2M at an average of $250 Once again however adding positions would have drove the price down not up So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of $280 while covering only 10 4M at exorbitant costs This likely didn't happen for several reasons First S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading however they would be at non ideal prices Second this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass the price would increase not decrease and when shorts sell en mass the price would decrease not increase Third this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother also highly unlikely given the hype at the time Fourth in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share and we know that at that time GME was hard to borrow What is more likely is the inverse of the above which would mean shorts covered 15 8M shares at an average cost of $300 then short sold 10 4M shares at an average of $250 before further covering 9 2M at an average of $250 Despite ideal circumstances that is not an ideal result for hedge funds That means hedge funds are not kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points that would be impossible Part 2 What About Last Friday Now this was an important day GME fought hard and closed at above $320 What makes this day confusing however are the claims that short interest drastically decreased Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question you can look into those on your own What I want to go over is how could it be remotely possible S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th however the share price had a net decreasing trend There were only 2 notable upward rallys and combined they only account for 24M shares If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves Where did the other 6M shares go I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday Also note that Short Volume was 17 6M on Friday So on Friday there was 50M in volume 17 6M of that volume was due to shares sold short so SI would be 57 8 SI as of the 28th 17 6M shares sold short 75 4M In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as S3 said it would have required the covering of 75 4M 27M 48 4M shares How do you cover 48 4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17 6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares At most 32 4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position which would make SI 75 4M 32 4M 43M It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday so the actual SI is likely much higher Furthermore I want to draw attention to other times shares were covered and their effect on the price and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday S3 claims that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th the SI went from 69M to 62M a decrease of 7M shares On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43 an 100 increase They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50 From the 25th to the 27th there was literally exponential growth in the share price despite no change in SI But then all of a sudden on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price How could that be remotely accurate There was 50M in volume on the 29th how could the purchase of 31M shares by a single entity not even accounting for retail result in a net decrease in share price Part 3 How Could They Do It Read this post and the sources within it in detail Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered when they have not There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases you do the math Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD Why are there bots everywhere in WSB Shorts haven't covered they can't cover and they wont They also did not shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances They want you to think they covered they also want you to think they have a better short position They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover nor could they find enough shares to reposition They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail TLDR Seriously read this whole thing I know you won't but do it Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday it would have been impossible based on volume alone They want you to think they did they need you to but they did not Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to

$GME $300 maybe you can explain it to them like this There's a rich kid in town Let's call him Melvin He thinks he's really smart He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units This is easy I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon Easiest $20 I'll ever make He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids He collects $200 each from 150 parents He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours His parents will be so proud There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time Let's call him Keith Keith doesn't like Melvin Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot Later in the day Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please Gamestop guy looks at him and says Sorry we're all sold out Melvin goes to the next Gamestop Same story All sold out He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch He won't be able to fulfill the orders Meanwhile Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought no matter how much he offers you Nobody likes Melvin so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch Melvin is in trouble His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch Melvins parents are angry but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150 This is how you get a short percentage over 100 Melvin has promised more than actually exist The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends but they had to pay really inflated prices for them first $1 000 then $2 000 now $3 000 It's nearing Christmas and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one They all start bidding against each other for Switches Everybody in town is in on the action now Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10 000 Meanwhile Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing Edit 1 Thanks for all the love and awards I'm really grateful I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's Edit 2 A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles In a more accurate version Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours he will give them each $5 per day The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers This is a naked short He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation Although there are 250 Switches in the city there are now only 100 Switches in circulation Keith's friends So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available 150 short position of float Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case the day after and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty $450 He'll still have made $3 000 $450 $2 550 The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches the more expensive it's going to be for him After 4 days he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play They also know that the price of Switches is rising Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1 000 to cancel the IOU they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market In addition the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15 000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1 000 So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it it's very difficult ,2021-01-30 23:42:15,"6.

cannabis market to moon and how to avoid becoming a bag holder when this all comes crashing down Obligatory SIR THIS IS A CASINO This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form TLDR This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50 80 or more from the levels they are at $CRLBF is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation We just like the stocks now not later Ok listen up normies Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post Don't post DD if you have no clue Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL Not even kidding So I made a new account This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining what is actually going on CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you The hedge funds are playing these right along with us Don't ask me for proof this isn't Twitter Reasons why they are playing with us 1 When there is money to be made hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you 2 The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains all the while handing you guys the bags That's all you need to know So in response to all you posting real DD with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell I'm over it I can tell instantly how uninformed you are when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation These are Canadian companies Get your head back on straight You're here for the trade and the bet not for the fundamentals and if that's it then fine ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit and if not read on so you don't hold more bags This place has never been one to care for fundamentals but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS Let's take a look at some of today's gainers changed tickers for automod avoidance $USMJay Penny stock worth absolute nothing for a reason $SNDL Up ridiculous amount have a billion shares outstanding just diluted them all the other day $TeeRTeeC Terra Tech they grow weed from all indications do it poorly $OhGeeEye lol $HUGE Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has x200B Now if you're simply playing this to get in and get out great for you The people saying and believing $SNDL $10 EOW HOLD THE LINE and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless do not listen to them If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan congrats take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20 of what it is worth now Literally They're far worse than the main bunch CGC CRON ACB TLRY APHA but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either x200B THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING Tilray had 40 short interest It's not $GME level but it's pretty high When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off why though Notice this week's FD option chain x200B Tilray has a 95M share float those 42 calls represent roughly 1 5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves Previous to this run up that represents roughly 5 of the average daily volume of the stock BY ITSELF Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge They may get loaned out to be shorted but that will only speed up the squeeze here The important part Today 2/10/21 the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66 The most sold front week call $40/$42 strikes Premium when I screen shotted this $22 20 Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls in which case it may squeeze itself higher Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this sell you the calls shove the price up to keep selling you calls then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain dump back the shares to help shove the price down oh and did I mention They shorted the top x200B It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze That's it with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume likely re shorting on the way up and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total a massive volume of 200 million shares today You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500 and it may but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up Might it get there Sure But be prepare to take profits when it does because ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER Not to mention the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies with horrible fundamentals and poor prospects Oh what's that CGC got some CBD treats for Martha seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading If the dog treats get you excited about the stock Martha belongs here more than you do 200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads What to take away An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands or in other words fewer reason for people to bag hold Fewer people that have to hedge Fewer people that have to cover Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers and keep the price stable by holding and more reason it's going to collapse sooner or later But this IS a casino after all Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened oh you're new here Yeah this isn't the first time x200B Looks eerily familiar to something else recently Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe For those of you that are new THIS IS NOT NORMAL STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS You are in the infancy of a new age of trading but people still know fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on and these valuations are getting extremely overextended Eventually in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2 43 a share At $2 43/share I would have bought it Even at $10/12/14 At these levels You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn So in short again Sir this is a casino x200B Timeline of events and how to not become a bagholder 1 $APHA earnings are good stocks pop a bit and level off 2 Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis notice we will likely NOT get outright legalization just re scheduling 3 $CGC earnings are actually awful with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon 4 $TLRY gets a UK deal 5 $TLRY starts going insane since $APHA is a reverse merger with a 81 value share to share it starts pumping people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on overall strength 6 There's no strength there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum and a short squeeze on Tilray 7 This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down just like the second graph I posted There is no fundamental or even POSSIBILITY of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like Yep Profits 8 Finally how to not become a bag holder The market can stay irrational way way way longer than you expect So this may go on for a bit but refer back to 7 It's coming back down eventually set expectations and pick your exit or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run Eventually you have to sell to actually realize a gain don't forget that Once you do close the chart remove it from your watchlist check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares But if Tilray comes crashing back down $APHA will as well along with all of them and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price THIS IS ALL JUST SENTIMENT BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also who will also become bag holders x200B Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION IF ANYTHING IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS x200B Who are the real players Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF do your own DD or wait for a post next week x200B Conclusion Nobody should plan on holding these long term Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play You likely will not time the top Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade exit the trade or slowly shave your position close the graphs and don't fomo back in Just be done with the trade afterwards You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago and in that case you belong here congrats on your gains and fuck you THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE AND IT WILL END THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER And if you think WE are the ones driving the price up the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want You're holding a lit molotov the only question is will you throw it before it blows up The rest of you Plz fuck off with you 20 shares $2 on Sundial fuck off with the HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW fuck off with your fomo and fuck off with the movement and lets push this to the sky stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on You know what lets push this to the sky sounds like Market manipulation We're not in this together I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month eventually that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it I ain't tipping you either These prices are insanely high for these companies The multiples are out of control and if you buy in at these levels well best of luck I hope it works out for you I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains and will continue to put my money elsewhere SIR THIS IS A CASINO Positions I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1 000 tomorrow and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent Disclaimer I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down x200B x200B Edit You know what I forgot to add Some of the biggest holders the cannabis ETFs and funds you know what they did today They trimmed their positions And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de concentrate shares into the retail's hands the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent Edit 2 Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill I had thousands of shares these are just the trades from this month and I'm not advocating a buy I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in You want the gain numbers You do the math I'm not your math tutor I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb Yeah I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person Edit 3 I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019 Yes it's the real SoRefreshing proof Edit 4 Eh don't request me with What should I do with XX be a big adult grown up and decide your own risk tolerance and exits I responded to the first 10 or so Now I have 100 I can't I disabled chat messages Edit 5 jesus with the awards go buy TSLA calls this is WSB not fb/twtr

high school which means I explain things to idiots every day If you still don't understand call options I got you I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them So here you go Note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified WHAT IS A CALL OPTION BASICS A call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date Example You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th What that means is that at any time between now and end of day on 3/19 you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400 If the price spikes to $700 dollars you can still buy them for $400 That's a pretty good deal So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even and anything above that is profit right Not quite You have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract The premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a $2 premium that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract which means that you pay $200 the buy the call $2/share x 100 shares You give the seller $200 and they give you the call option Since you paid $200 for the option this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share Why Because if the price only got to $400 you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste However if the price goes to $403/share then you make a profit because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share But what if the price doesn't go up or even goes down Do I have to still buy those shares for $400 No You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to Remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400 but not the obligation But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40 000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40 000 sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position Regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM or in the money What does that mean Let's look at some option vocabulary CALL OPTION VOCABULARY Strike Price This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract In our $400 call option above the strike price is $400 At any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock Exercise Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock In the example above you would spend $40 000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock No If you can't afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else Expiration Date This is when your call expires if you have a 3/19 expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19 Premium The premium is the price you pay to the call seller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share Knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of 25 If you do the math it will cost you $25 which is 25/share x 100 shares ITM and OTM In the Money and Out of the Money ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price If you have a $400 call and the price of GME goes to $405 then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400 If you then immediately sold the stock for $405 you'd make money OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350 then your call is OTM It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium if GME goes to $401 you are ITM because 401 400 but you haven't broken even yet because your break even price is $402 FDs FD is not an investment term and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls It is a WSB term and it stands for maggot's delight but with an F because autmod won't let me define FDs FDs are OTM calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble The guy who spent 90k on 1dte 1 day to expiration OTM GME calls Those were all FDs and they all expired worthless Why are they called FDs Because when you buy FDs you usually end up taking it in the ass WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT You have probably seen something like this GME $400c 3/19 Let's break it down GME $400c 3/19 The GME stands for Gamestop which you probably figured out The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400 If it said $400p it would be a put option but we'll talk about those later The 3/19 stands for the expiration date Now let's make it more complicated If I said I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19 what do I mean It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration and I paid $5 per share If I paid $5 per share how much did I spend on my contracts I spent $5 000 $5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts Now you try it A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share How would you explain to me that you bought two of them You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19 Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS This is confusing Why do people even do this People buy call options because you can make a lot of money If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price then for every $1 the share price goes above your break even price you make $100 If you have a $400c with a break even of $402 and the price gets to $412 then you make $1 000 profit That's $10 of profit $412 $402 times 100 shares You can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money It is usually better to sell the contract but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS When you buy a stock at least you own the stock If you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME / 5 depending on when he bought on Thursday Instead he has nothing WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING So you bought a call option and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money That's because there are actually two types of value in an option options have Intrinsic Value and Extrinsic Value Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option If you own a $400c and the price is $412 then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share or $1200 because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up Pretty easy Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility For example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM because more time more chances for the price to rise Therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration Conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases This is called theta decay but you don't need to worry about that Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM This is reflected in a measurement called IV or Implied Volatility Like Theta Decay IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics Due to the factors of time theta and volatility IV constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time This is why the value of your option will constantly change Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility Your option value will decrease as IV drops Is the stock starting to jump around Your option value will increase as IV increases Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing Why do you think that is If the stock value is increasing slowly but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS You can sell your contracts at any time You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts This is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290 If he had sold then he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button They get your money and you get their shares This can take some time OK I GET IT BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price To buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit The End SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY No You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous Don't go crazy Buy a call See how it works for real Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge Or do Live your life how you want I'm not your dad Just make sure you post the

"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years",23529,mbx510,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/,2477,1616587834.0,SLV is a complete scam its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors Avoid it at all costs The silver market is and has been rigged for years WSB was never moving into silver The media got the story wrong Think about who reads weekend financial news Old people The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s and these people are now in their 70s Who clicks on ads Basically only old people Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise and media likes to make money through click through revenue Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market you could not be more wrong Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played The general theme could be described as this If banks hold the silver the price is allowed to rise but if you hold the silver the price is forced to fall Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze and he had one line that was especially profound “In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze the shorts are the ETFs the ETFs buy the physical they turn around and sell on the COMEX ” – Jeff Currie of Goldman This was shocking to holders of SLV because SLV is a long only silver ETF They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault They have no price risk if the price of silver declines it’s the investors who lose money not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX Further their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all So how is the ETF shorting silver They aren’t The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver its custodian JP Morgan is shorting silver This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs Moreover he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors He truly meant what he said What is a custodian you ask The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys sells and stores the silver All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring Instead JPM and a few sub custodian banks accumulated a large amount of silver segmented it off into LBMA vaults and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows Thus ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver When the SLV receives inflows JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange As the price drops silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out x200B reduce reuse recycle An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future What does this even mean Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price more silver will be available to purchase But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market that’s actually not the case What SLV was admitting here was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows beyond what JPM will allow them to The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing controlled supply This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets and its unnatural For example when millions of people buy GME stock it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock causing the price to rise When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly which puts a bid under the price of oil But when millions of people buy SLV it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver The price of silver is determined separately and SLV is completely in the position of price taker So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market The series runs from April 2007 through February 2021 I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows banks add to short positions on the COMEX and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze just not by using SLV One other thing that is evident is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows is starting to break down Specifically beginning in the summer of 2020 as deliveries began to surge the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows It’s likely one or more banks see the risk and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens having seen what happened with GME For further evidence of this theme of “If banks hold the silver the price is allowed to rise but if you hold the silver the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself x200B You’ll notice that as long as futures investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered the price of silver was allowed to rise but whenever deliveries showed an uptick the price would begin to fall once again This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down and then acquire the silver you need But just like the graph of the bank net short position you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020 and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries The short squeeze is underway and the dam is about to break And lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff take delivery and make them feel the losses of their short position SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world with 600 million ounces of silver under its control and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits nor do independent audits occur I’m not saying the silver isn’t there but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this Well there is currently one ETF that is outside this system and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows That ETF is PSLV from Sprott Founded by Eric Sprott a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery Further PSLV buys its silver directly it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA and it is independently audited By purchasing the PSLV ETF retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace And if a premium occurs among primary dealers deliveries will occur in the futures market This is what is starting to happen right now a premium has developed among primary dealers and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge while COMEX inventories have begun to decline And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27 silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes compared to only 15k on the original silver post This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB However given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors is it really that much of a surprise Additionally that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV That's only 0 04 of Citadel's AUM Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0 04 of their AUM was in SLV This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV That's what a market maker does They have long and short positions in just about everything There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper but they never mention silver Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze starting with the silver market itself Silver is priced in the futures market and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity So once their contract date nears they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date Historically only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy If the right to take delivery didn’t exist then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality Industrial players and large scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass They only do it if they really have to Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price thus incentivizing taking delivery Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market Most shorts the sellers in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight But even as deliveries are made each month you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years After adding in the 3 6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered This is a massive increase relative to previous years and also an all time record for Q1 from the data that I can find Even more stark is the chart showing deliveries on a 12 month trailing basis which I also showed earlier Note You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is As you can see from the chart starting in the month of April 2020 deliveries have gone completely parabolic While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze The 2001 2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x In the 2020s however we have a fundamentals based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX As you can see from the graph and the chart above COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace To explain a bit further the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it However the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered they then become eligible and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category 1/3 of an ounce or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American If just 1 of Americans purchased $1 000 worth of the PSLV ETF it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver the entire registered inventory of the COMEX That’s how tight this market is Right now we are sending most Americans a $1 400 check If 1 of them converted it to silver through PSLV this market could truly explode higher And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level It looks almost unreal And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves That light brown line was February 2021 and look how its deliveries compared to previous years 12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021 A month that is not a primary delivery month and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra month deliveries being added it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces 20 million ounces in a non active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see Here’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in yes CFTC the shorts did this to themselves Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May x200B If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver With 127 million ounces in the registered category and 652 million ounces in the money most of it from futures rather than options the short interest as a of the float is roughly 513 Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic As registered inventories dwindle longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver Of course the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher There is always silver available if the price is high enough Like the situation with GameStop the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities There were always shares of GME available to purchase it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders The GME short squeeze may indeed continue because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME they can’t force them to sell In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers the duo that orchestrated the squeeze to do they actually forced them to sell The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze In the squeeze of 1979 1980 the regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market Or in reality the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’ The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each or just Warren Buffet on his own but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each There is no cornering the market going on This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors But what about beyond a short squeeze Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis There are two types of bull markets in silver One is a fundamentals based bull market where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years However the 1971 80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971 where both a short squeeze and fundamentals based rally occur simultaneously Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market and are signaling another generational bull market So what are these ‘smoke alarms’ I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC pronounced ‘smoke’ The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver Money supply and Economy Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy or GDP More specifically if you look at the chart below you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP monthly from 1960 through 2020 When this ratio is rising it means that the broad money supply M3 is increasing faster than the economy and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class is the valuation that you enter the market at Silver is no different but being a commodity rather than cash flow producing asset how does one value silver It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver Enter the SMOEC indicator The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying In other words SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above M3/GDP More specifically it is LN Silver Price / M3/Nominal GDP Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021 I want to bring your attention to the blue long term trendline for SMOEC and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea Essentially when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line Since 1965 SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times The first occurrence was in October 1971 where SMOEC bottomed at 0 79 and proceeded to increase 3 41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4 20 in February of 1980 literally 420 I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high Silver rose from $1 31 to $36 13 or a 2 658 gain using the end of month values the daily close trough to peak was even greater Over this same period the S P 500 returned only 67 with dividends reinvested Silver a metal with no cash flows outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8 5 years neither return is adjusted for inflation This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals based rally The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2 10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2 32 points over the next decade to peak at 4 42 in April of 2011 Silver rose from $4 14 to $48 60 an increase of over 1000 and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities The S P 500 with dividends reinvested returned only 41 in this 9 5 year period Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x neither figure adjusted for inflation There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market Over the long term it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver but over specific 8 10 year periods of time silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring silver drastically outperforms Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points but in real terms inflation adjusted they actually lost 94 This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities x200B I in no way think this is coming to the United States I do think inflation will rise and the value of the dollar will fall but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse Fortunately for silver investors a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade Back to SMOEC though The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2 91 Silver was priced at $14 96 at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver coming off of the 2011 highs Starting in April 2020 silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3 37 as of March 2021 Silver is 0 46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3 4 points once again Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations LN scale because silver is nature’s money so it just felt right The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021 An increase of 3 4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out And there’s really no reason it must stop there The recent money supply growth has been extreme and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits it is expected that monetary expansion will continue This is why bonds and have been selling off recently and why yields are soaring Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 a drop of 20 or more The 40 year bull market bond streak just ended What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up just look at the 5 year expected inflation rate Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE Stimulus checks higher unemployment benefits child tax credit expansion PPP grants deferral of loan payments and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant They are not funded by increased taxes they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed As structural unemployment remains high low unemployment is a fed mandate I don’t see these programs letting up and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way The $1 9 trillion bill was just passed and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3 4 trillion This is the trap that the fed finds itself in Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher but the nation’s debt levels public and private have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run during a time that unemployment is already high So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself They will keep short term rates at 0 and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields as was done in the 1940s the only other time debt levels were this high So where does the air come out of this bubble if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation The value of the dollar We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy and likely in terms of other currencies as well depending on how much money creation they perform The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time like has been the case since 2008 is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment In the short term unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts but in the longer term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs and when they brag about creating jobs know that the decision was never about jobs but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies Recently the best way to get rid of workers is through automation Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so because it is only paying $5k a year in up keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front In this situation at 10 interest rates the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years At 2 interest rates though the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years The business environment is uncertain and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates On top of the automation trend low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment In an industry with 3 competitors the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable Lacking competitive pressures the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment Of course our absolutely spineless anti trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed And as structural unemployment continues universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand funded by debt Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets It’s a vicious cycle but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals especially silver And guess what expensive robotics electric vehicles satellites rockets medical imaging tech solar panels and a bevy of other fast growing technologies utilize as an input Silver Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity its highly reflective and it extremely durable So encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation Well government is more than replacing lost income so far just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance Sure inflation might only peak at 5 or 10 and while silver rises 100 but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon The Venezuela example proves that fact but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation just high inflation During these times of higher inflation holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse they just want 1 5 or even 10 of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge During the 40 year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor and virtually no one has it any longer I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks let alone actually owning any A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more x200B x200B TLDR SLV is a scam as are basically all of the silver ETFs If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low or PSLV Disclaimer I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion,2021-03-24 14:10:34,

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,48807,lalucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/,2395,1612263785.0,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions TLDR Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit They've been illegally closing out their short positions and if we hold they will 100 get fucked There is far more nefarious shit at play So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above 120 short interest still I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close 50 of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week This got me digging around to figure out what's up I started by looking into GME failed to delivers i e short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan GME had 1 2 MILLION failed to delivers This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying What was interesting though is that of that 1 2million 700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road Having spent some time looking at the pattern it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in then a small chunk of coverage then another large amount and so on To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article In it a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME Assuming that XYZ e g GME is a hard to borrow security e g apes holding strong and that Trader A Melvin or its broker dealer is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker dealer’s close out requirement but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale Most often this is done through the use of a buy write trade but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions ” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close out a fail The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen in combination with the ladder attacks My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th I 100 think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud In fact I would bet all my money on it oh wait I did 96 GME 290 I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail More DD Not a financial adviser I eat paint chips for dinner EDIT Ok so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million What I'm doing is summing all the debits to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about 10M We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect I got mixed around when I wrote this initially The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was 80 The 120 figure for S3 was correct Please checkout the linked DD it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can Share this post and the related DD We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening If I take an L to 0 I take an L to 0 I don't invest what I can't lose

GME - POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF,18378,lxwhpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/,2318,1614923733.0,GME POSSIBILITY OF GAMMA SQUEEZE JUST WENT THROUGH THE ROOF As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options TL DR the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball Here is what I did Pulled the option chain data into excel ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info What is a gamma squeeze For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5 Gamma squeezes revolve around options I wont go into too much detail here on what those are but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM in the money of course the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME $15 goes to $150 Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge which of course will cause that price to rise more and more Now that GME is $130 Today was a great day GME closed up $8 17 or 6 58 maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for but on a down market day is pretty incredible Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait GME Options Exp 2021 03 05 This Friday GME $100 Last Fridays Close Option Expiry At this level going into Friday we could expect 22 427 in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised About 2 242 700 to be exact or about 4 97 of the TOTAL FLOAT Crazy GME $130 We can expect 35 989 contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130 A solid 13 562 more contracts than at the $100 level This equates to 3 598 900 shares or 7 97 of total float Now we're getting nutty What about GME $150 Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM In fact closing above this price means there would be 46 397 contracts ITM This means that a whopping 4 639 700 shares or 10 27 of total float MORE THAN DOUBLE $100 What does this mean Well not every contract will be exercised even ITM These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised 10 of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand it means more contracts will come ITM next week and then more again the week after and so on With the steady price rise we've been seeing it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME There's been crazy volume at times particularly today the day before contract expiry Any how ill put away my tinfoil hat What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning the first domino's Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond No not really but it sure does increase the odds of that happening We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves We all saw what happened with RH and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took its just the action that we were able to see Summary Since last Friday 2021 02 26 last option expiry the number of contracts possibly ITM has DOUBLED I repeat DOUBLED If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised 10 of total float will be called on Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close $130 there is still 50 more contracts ITM than last week All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big x200B Ill say it again for those in the back DOUBLED Mic drop Not financial advice this is just for fun Any questions feel free to ask away ,2021-03-05 07:55:33,"4. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

"Let me clear the air here regarding GME, AMC, & CLOV",14803,of0hls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of0hls/let_me_clear_the_air_here_regarding_gme_amc_clov/,2117,1625594784.0,Let me clear the air here regarding GME AMC CLOV Alright you retards I'm taking the initiative to clear the air I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes but I'm going to be straight up honest here We are not a team this is not a cult and this is not fucking collusion GME AMC CLOV are three completely different plays Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude GME Was being shorted because as per technicals it was a company that was going to shit bankruptcy if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E Commerce and the like Additionally the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of 140 Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur The stock picked up gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day Why because the remaining 15 20 short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses thus still considered a major play the company making big changes to their board of directors adding e commerce and more etc AMC This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME The SI on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20 This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in AMC due to the retail investors Picking this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success hopefully When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company Again the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail Now the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses Also seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID 19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again thus making AMC still a very big play CLOV Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO This had nothing to do with GME or AMC The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub segment that hasn't changed in ages This stock has a large short interest now probably greater then AMC and GME combined low float no debt and has a very bright future for growth It's also heavily invested by Alphabet Google and other major players The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC separate that from your minds Yes Melvin Capital Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC but this has no relevance to CLOV No one gives a fuck a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV That's it simple as that All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays Yes a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock But get this through your heads THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY They are completely different in respect to each other WSB is a casino we're here to place bets and hope for the best This is not a team sport this is not a cult and this is not collusion If you don't like a stock then don't throw money at it But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole most of you are chill af just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC Now with this shit said I'm a big supporter of all 3 But for fuck sakes they are not the same play stop comparing the 3 Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved Everyone needs to chill the fuck out play your plays and keep it moving Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all BB and NOK became Meme stocks because fundamentally they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future People just need to stop comparing and having these debates 3 stocks 3 completely different plays fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous Also the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up people bag holding these stocks will sell why Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills mortgages/rent their children etc and with the cost of living cost of commodities inflating due to inflation I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions shorting these stocks until this occurs They're banking that when shit goes tits up the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs My personal opinion Some plays on WSB are value plays short squeeze plays gamma squeeze plays undervalued plays oversold plays etc the fucking list goes on WSB is a god damn casino so treat it as such I wish you all the best and many tendies regardless of what you're invested in Downvote me to oblivion idgaf Important update I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards upvotes and comments I want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post When I was referring to 15 20 short sellers for GME I was not referring to short interest or the naked shorts everyone is talking about Simply that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet same goes for AMC and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330 I wasn't talking about the big MOASS I've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself I was here before there was 500k members I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock/investment subreddits etc Hopefully this clears some shit up Again the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this cult like attitude/behaviour Oh and the reason why my post mentions GME AMC CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on

GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.,23924,lbe80d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbe80d/gme_and_80_stocks_why_to_not_worry/,2080,1612351027.0,GME and $80 Stocks Why to not worry Oh my god GME is down to $150 It's down to $100 It's down to 30 cents The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point It's over Wrong No one is selling at these prices Sure maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better Maybe they trigger a few stop losses Maybe some margins get called But it's not enough Say it with me PRICE DOESN'T MATTER WHAT You heard me 30cent GME No problem They don't need a low price they need your shares If 10 people sell at 30c cents and that's the only market activity it's a 30 cent stock but Melvin only netted ten shares They are still fucked They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c nor $100 nor $300 and that's their problem It's an availability issue Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue too high for them but primarily it's the availability All the activity driving down the listed share price are illegal ladder attacks not that legality should be expected at this point these folk are crooks Those aren't actual sales though it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie They aren't gobbling up value These people don't admit defeat they are neither smart nor humble they are crooks They need 50 million shares They need over 100 of the float to sell to them that 50 float you hear about is accounting shennaigans ignore it they are still exposed You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM I'll explain that in a second but first let me repeat PRICE DOESN'T MATTER So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market of Shares Price x 20 $0 30c x 80 $5 x 400 $20 x 600 $40 x 900 $60 x 2 000 $100 x 5 000 $150 x 10 000 $200 x 30 000 $300 x 50 000 $400 x 150 000 $500 x 1 mil $1 000 x 15 mil $5 000 x 30 mil $69 420 Get it There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices By the time you've bought a quarter million shares 0 5 of what you need to buy you're back up to the sustained highs And these are just exaggerations to make a point A stock price only reflects current trade values not availability at those prices If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment There's no volume to buy up at those costs No one can force you to sell at a Nickel Get it PRICE DOESN'T MATTER They need our shares not a low price The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not Their financial reserves indicate that but there isn't a ticker for that But be sure every day the inevitable closes in Sell out of fear if you like but you'll just miss out in the end People like me as we shore up more funds snipe these low prices stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones This isn't financial advice I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation ,2021-02-03 13:17:07,"1. {""GME"": ""Drop"", ""NOK"": ""NULL"", ""BB"": ""NULL""}"

Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short-squeezing investors,16505,l7fw0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fw0x/i_used_to_work_merrill_heres_what_likely_happened/,1976,1611914262.0,I used to work Merrill Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short squeezing investors I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize rather than be upset Worked Merrill as an analyst from 2014 2016 I also like to keep it concise so follow along This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction Disclaimer I own GME This is not financial advice This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies 1 Robinhood restrictions suppression When you place an order through RH Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread However the transaction is not complete Enter Clearing house The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter parties Because they stand between sellers buyers they have very defined levels of risk risk management and regulation to be in front of The clearing house is who gives you the title for your shares the folks who make it official What Likely Happened The risk department retard the clearing house who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C Suite frazzled He has looked at option open interest expiring this week has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway shape or form turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert It's simply not enough In addition they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey if you fucking keep selling open positions you're on your own we ain't gonna help you SEC is sneaky like that they like sending messages through the backdoor not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves If you're not following Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists So they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME there simply isn't enough float the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a failure to deliver 2 Failure to Deliver This is a pretty fucking big deal Bigger than you imagine because it's basically a slam dunk law suit Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties in this case the firm who sold you the option RH or the clearing house has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position profit or certificate Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered There simply isn't enough for everyone Thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of failures to deliver big risk 3 Liability You must be asking so what Fuck them They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me the customer the right to choose or whatever the fuck That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions If they fail to they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER How many people have options on GME on RH Half Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house There would be no Robinhood left There would likely be no clearing house left Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T Mobile they had to pull the plug Hence Bad Decision Bankruptcy or worse WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH there's definitely coordination all around but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal Couple of semi related notes Fuck Billionaires Parasites of modern society simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people them in the streets them in the them from skyscrapers Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel the HF would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC They cleared over 6 billion net last year so just logically it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel simply because it's such a money maker If you were an evil genius would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short The media just wants clicks and engagement so they will bring the worst people on simply to pad their own bottom line Don't get engaged Don't give in to them Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall street however you please The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive not reactive TL DR There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened hence restrictions What will happen now Based on my previous short squeezes Friday tomorrow will be nuts All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float I'm guessing up up up up up

expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in the money It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you Yes Call options We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now right No That's not how this works Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers or writers have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't It's called delta hedging You don't need to know all the fancy math delta and gamma are those greek symbols for nerds just understand this as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money you hedge more This is a continuous PROCESS not a discreet moment in time The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think Shit I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up I have to BUY NOW That would be stupid They are hedging all the way up I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already So no gamma squeeze Probably not significantly They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320 then We did have a gamma squeeze at $320 On Wednesday two days ago The price exceeded $320 then the highest strike price on the books and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320 That's what a gamma squeeze is a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls It typically happens BEFORE expiration not after It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from This hurts my feelings So what's so great about the $320 threshold anyway Did it matter at all It's still a good thing There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover And like I said it's always good to make put holders lose money because stick it to the 🌈🐻 that's why $320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike You can see the entire option chain here Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in the money at today's close I think maybe 90 000 or something Screw it I didn't count Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up Multiply that number by 100 because option contracts are sold in groups of 100 and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market some weird things could happen What weird things Well if nothing else a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares they don't necessarily own own the shares right at that moment When you press buy on your phone and it says your order was filled that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned sure the process looks instant However there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled who owes whom and what they owe and at what price etc Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks in a market with only 50 something million shares actively circulating gets settled It might not be crazy but it could We'll see Michael Burry Christian Bale for all you noobs seems to think that all the naked short selling above the float will result in a shit storm when people actually go to get their shares back Liquidity crunch lots of shares being moved around nobody knows where they all are currently potential nightmare for Wall Street I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies so how do we get the MOASS Something needs to be the catalyst Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater so much so that they are drowning That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze pocalypse the Mother of All Short Squeezes The bastards at the brokerages acting with and for the clearing houses took your tendies It's criminal what played out I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today as well as the price shot up to $378 around noon If it had gotten to $400 it stood a very good chance of running up to $500 which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond Then Robinhood said Oh actually you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore only 2 now The price came back down again Oddly enough the S P500 sold off over a full percentage point that's a lot of money right after GME hit that $378 peak Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket How will Wall Street defend themselves They will try to keep snipping the fuse That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves They need to become a self sustaining chain reaction fed by hedging pressure And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing I hate to tell you this but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost It's bullshit Eat the rich But there it is Do you feel you've used the word squeeze too much by now Yes I've been writing and looking at the word squeeze so much that it is starting to lose its meaning Squeeze Squeeze Squeeeeeeze x200B EDIT TL DR Shares most likely already bought so no gamma squeeze doesn't matter anyway 🙌💎🚀 🙌💎🚀 🙌💎🚀 EDIT 2 STOP THANKING ME FOR THIS POST RETARDS Literally the first sentence is me giving credit to the original poster THANK HIM ,2021-01-30 14:56:58,2.

of months or I'M SHAVING OFF MY PRECIOUS BEARD The TA Gods have spoken to me in sleep and after that I handcrafted this masterpiece TA applying the anatomy of two most famous historical squeezy examples VW and TSLA to current GME x200B The GME thesis which I aim to explain via the comparison with VW and TSLA daily chart x200B Sup honorable apecitizens Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA and now I am finally ready to share that with you I am so confident in it that I dared to put my beard which I have for five years already on the line Worth your full read I promise I decided to structure the analysis in the following way first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks through which the GMESS thesis will be dissected applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example then the process will be repeated but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon Finally all of the data accumulated in the process as well as the major findings made will be applied to the current technical state of GME in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action Buckle up and eat a crayon let's start Oh and one more thing I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first and then in the aggregate zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences interdependences and probabilities Dafaq did I just write Dunno but that's exactly what I meant Not a financial advice as I am not a professional advisor just an amateur ANALyzer x200B x200B Volkswagen Das Short Squeeze Sep 2007 Mar 2009 x200B x200B Remember when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading I bet Pepperidge apes remember The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario orchestrated largely by one very interesting person Back then the former President of Porsche Wendelin Wiedeking must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen In this process he used cash settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations While being acquired by Porsche Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan hedge funds and particularly short sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries approximately 70 While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased the preferential shares stayed put and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence For a moment there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence Only to get blindsided as it turned out later One shorts frying weekend Porsche announced its total holding in VW cornering the substantial part of the float and leaving only 6 in free float In the meantime short sales had risen to 12 of total stock outstanding When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74 1 of the outstanding shares through the in transparent cash settled options VWSS happened briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world and finally allowing the shorting side to GUH x200B It was mathematically impossible for every short seller to buy a share and therefore close their position In other words half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out A panicked dash for the exit began x200B — A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell an FT journalist Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock What is really ironic in Palpatine voice even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created and ended up being acquired by VW instead Also interestingly enough after his departure from Porsche Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success Lucking Fegend x200B Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart VWSS Daily Chart Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance don't worry I'll explain There are only two major TA instruments used here namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels check out the in depth explanation of this TA tool in my other post The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods pink vertical grid with numbers 0 0 382 0 618 and so on for setting the major time landmarks and zones Furthermore you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures and the purple line which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis In the process of working with VW TSLA and GME charts I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts to one degree or another The most prominent one in my opinion is the killer purple resistance/support level For the current VW example it is somewhere around $30 mark or $29 27 if you like precision One may observe on the chart above that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS First the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007 was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008 This was followed by a consolidation with several failed attempts of breakout just below this level which lasted for more than 100 days before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08 And guess what Even after that the level played the major supportive role for the price action with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008 You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix I decided to name it Purple Haze Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance The first one in orange is a cup shaped consolidation let it be called the Squeezy Grail because why not taking place above 100 Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze' which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature if you know what else is of a flatter nature comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart The second consolidation highlighted by the pink rectangle a k a the Runway is actually more important than the first one because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off in the middle of 0 382 period Based on that observation it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0 382 Fibo time zone during the 'Runway' stage Finally the triangular Squieezluminati Confirmed part is self explanatory imho Oh just one commentary worth being made here take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate bipartite and fits well into the isosceles triangle The nature surely knows how to play with stonks too Especially when we talk about Fibonacci The horizontal 🌈 grid Fibo retracement is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application because on that day another important resistance of $20 72 was penetrated for the first time then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08 Furthermore $20 72 level works like an ideal 100 Fibo retrace level for the current example and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me Also take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle in between 78 6 and 100 of Fibo retracement an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend based Fib time grid TBFTG to be fucked then go alternatively This one is a complex instrument so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it Just like Fibo retracement TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence but this one applies to time periods instead of the price action and levels In order to use this instrument properly it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods Oh it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends trust me Tbh it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA But the result was worth the effort I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS and hypothetically to GME too TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified and I'm talking about all of the examples but possible especially when looking at the TA as a whole referring to how the grid applies to the price action and comparing the examples between each other That is pure rocket science if you ask me And most importantly the TBFTG measurement duration pink dash and dash trend seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis check the bars measurements on all of the charts blue lines for VW Pay attention to the following features which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone peaking at 1 TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail' as it has been mentioned above Furthermore the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized Noice but let's move further x200B x200B Tesla or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme Destroyer of shorts” Apr 2019 Apr 2020 x200B x200B Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis and even after the run ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for now the former have been winning The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark to market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020 as the company’s shares exploded 740 last year This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners a fin anal company Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania' The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price Elon Musk openly criticized the short sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50 from November 2018 to May 2019 After that amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations the tables have turned and the bear beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price not without noble WSBetters help definitely Needless to say that previously steady short sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions x200B Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor B2B media that shorting Tesla is The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen x200B Well Mr Dusaniwsky WSB seem to have an answer for everything x200B While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise or even do worse things if you know what I mean Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled In the middle of 2020 Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts' These now sell at a premium on Ebay It's all nice and good but I have another cool merch idea ' shortz r fuk ' TSLASS Daily Chart x200B Beautiful isn't it Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW First things first the 'Squeezy Grail' is present but it resembles more of a V shape structure Next the 'Runway' stage is good looking a fucking massive gap happened there and this time 78 6 Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway' being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure but rather a 'chainsaw' like volatile price action taking place Furthermore you may see that inside of the triangle there is the after peak 78 6 Fibo zone retest which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of Moon Blessed be the bulls Looking at the 'Purple Haze' which is again in between Fibo 78 6 and 100 important for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52 46 During the first half of 2019 this level played a role of a magnetizing support with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April Again a lengthy half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level and above Fibo 100 retracement The breakout occurs you guessed right in the TBFTG 0 382 zone And what is really fascinating is the fact that after the breakout the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested But who knows what the future holds And the Fibos The retracement again apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure 78 6 is trialed several times all of the upper levels except for 38 2 were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23 6 Fibo level and the high of $189 4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze Ah almost forgot 100 $35 75 Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too Particularly the downtrend as opposed to VW uptrend serves as the core for TBFTG's application again refer to the dash and dash pinkish line This core is composed of the pre 'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself Take a look at gray measurements which cover this phase and the triangle duration again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases Crucially the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone again then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone with the false first peak during the final stages of 0 618 and the proper peak at 1 Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above if you ask me Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account Two quotes are of a relevance here x200B Coincidences mean you're on the right path Simon van Booy x200B If you gaze long enough into an asshole the asshole will gaze back into you u/roman axt x200B Some additional food for thought from TSLA For redditors with a different floor x200B x200B Game stopped or it is just a beginning x200B x200B I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME so I will not bother you here with the background explanation There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA GMESS Daily Chart x200B At this point I feel that a disclaimer is necessary Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way and my beard supports my manly confidence However this is the market and it all may go another way at any point in time that's the nature of things Think critically learn and do your own DD and TA In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative at least And so it begins Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze' I should remind you that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above Then the shapes The 'Squeezy Grail' again occurring in between 78 6 and 100 consolidation is also easily identifiable here and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation where the price action currently stands Remember how historically in TSLA and VW the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action in 0 382 Fibo time zone Well to paraphrase Ian Fleming once is VW happenstance Twice is TSLA coincidence Three times is GMenemy action Fibos Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass Firstly because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument being ordinarily applied to the completed trend But since the situation is not ordinary at all I played smarter or more autistic if you like Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78 6 and 100 Fibo in both of the previous examples I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78 6 by the price action on Jan 28th And when these two major levels were identified the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze Fibos' initiation point zoomed in x200B Why Because this ☝️ is clearly where the fun started And now it all matches perfectly So I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken And what do you do fellow retard x200B x200B x200B x200B They say that coincidence doesn't happen a third time I say we shall see TL DR is in the comments P S Here is the most precious thing that I can offer you my Crayon summative drawings x200B EDIT Here you go boy

GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile,17056,lb7ndd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb7ndd/gme_liquidy_is_drying_up_causing_the_share_to/,1656,1612331555.0,GME liquidy is drying up causing the share to become more and more volatile I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from this savant's post As the free flowing stock dries up due to ppl buying and holding the volatility increases It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money As long as you keep holding and buying the volatility will only increase Expect huge swings in the next few days Hedge funds know this They tanked the stock this morning Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable to make it look like the ride is over HOWEVER The short float is still high and the volume has been steadily decreasing Furthermore institutional ownership only picked up about 12m shares and some of those went to institutions that were long not short Now maybe I'm misreading this or maybe they're fudging the data but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume ACTIVE POSITIONS HOLDERS SHARES New positions 46 12 880 726 Sold out positions 34 3 412 841 Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short interest than is currently in GME The main problem is that retail investors unlike huge firms can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure rather than a sudden event The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope and this stock is still extremely volatile Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price Disclaimer I am a poker player not a day trader In poker this is what we call an implied odds play The risk is relatively small for us bulls relative to the short position but the expected value is potentially huge if it works But these plays are still risky despite being EV You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance This is pure uneducated speculation not financial advice TL/DR Grit your teeth and brace for swings Shit's about to get nuts Edit deleted the thing about being put on the short restriction list I screwed up the dates and added the institutional ownership thing ,2021-02-03 07:52:35,5.

"With regard to the ""they're just defining a short squeeze"" and ""this language is common in SEC filings"" response to the GME 10-K filing",28937,mbtpwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbtpwa/with_regard_to_the_theyre_just_defining_a_short/,1632,1616576482.0,With regard to the they're just defining a short squeeze and this language is common in SEC filings response to the GME 10 K filing Here's the thing about legal filings and CYA turns of phrase the lawyers who craft these documents do so based on precedent and are encouraged to reuse legal terms as much as possible in order to avoid misinterpretation Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10 K filings for specific phrases Let's see just how common this language is shall we First the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety x200B The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company For example on January 28 2021 our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra day trading high of $483 00 per share and a low of $112 25 per share In addition from January 11 2021 to March 17 2021 the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19 94 to as high as $347 51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7 060 000 to 197 200 000 shares During this time we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock In particular a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock further influencing volatility in its market price Additionally these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to and may continue to lead to extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock Those repurchases may in turn dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing This is often referred to as a “short squeeze ”A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders or the perception that these sales may occur may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline Our employees directors and officers and their affiliates hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders or the perception that such sales will occur may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws or pursuant to our securities trading policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of nonpublic material information we have no Total number of 10 K filings roughly estimated by the number of hits for the phrase report over five year 254 473 filings and ten year 513 510 filings periods x200B How often does extremely volatile appear in SEC 10 K filings The phrase is found in 968 of all 10 K

Department Horror Stories of the shitshow that is Robinhood told by someone who is reviewing processing your ACATs PART 1 So I'll start this by saying Yes if you look at my post history I mostly just openly troll you autists I've made fun of the conspiracy theories mostly bc 99 of you don't understand the importance of market integrity and I've openly mocked the simps who joined WSB so they could be join the revolution I'm OG WSB this sub was about autistic YOLO plays that made no sense coming up w/ retarded strategies bragging about tendies and telling people to long $ROPE when they blew their accounts up and cried about it I'm the WSB equivalent of an old guy yelling at you kids to get off my lawn HOWEVER the things I've seen over the past week as Fidelity is forced to restrict brand new accounts bc of RH reject perfectly good ACATs bc of RH and watch as clients are shocked to hear the actual rules behind trading that the ENTIRE REST OF THE INDUSTRY USES are 100 lawsuit worthy In the interest of time ease of reading and the desire to answer questions I will break these up into multiple parts Feel free to AMA in comments and I will respond as best I can Assuming people find this helpful part 2 will be coming soon If this post just ends up deleted by the bot then /shrug at least I posted it Part 1 Securities purchased using margin in RH accounts when the client had cash available to cover the position So RH is one of the only the only firm where you just get margin as a part of opening your account Now when I say margin I mean the thing that allows you to buy more stonks than you have funds in the account Please note Having margin ON an account is different than having a MARGIN ACCOUNT A margin account simply means that you have the ability to have the proceeds available for trade immediately after placing a sale Not all securities are marginable which is why some securities like GME the other week required that you wait for the trade to settle before those funds became available to trade again Having margin ON an account means your brokerage firm is giving you a line of credit through which you can purchase more stonks than you have the cash to cover they charge you interest for this and this is how you can be margin called simply by holding stonks that you paid for Having margin ON an account ALSO means that unless you sold the stonk within a few days of the initial purchase you pay interest for using their money to buy/hold said stonk FIDELITY ACCOUNTS REQUIRE THAT YOU FILL OUT A MARGIN AGREEMENT in order to have margin ON your account As such when a security that has been purchased on margin hits an account without margin like a freshly opened Fidelity account the new account is restricted the ACAT potentially rejected and/or the client immediately is faced with a margin call at Fidelity WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU Check your RH accounts If your positions show as being held in margin when you have cash available there is a good chance that Robinhood rather than using the available cash to facilitate your securities purchase instead purchased using the margin on the account In many cases we are seeing clients who are looking back and realizing they've been being charged margin interest without realizing it THIS IS NOT LEGAL If you have the cash available in your account to purchase a security unless you specifically state otherwise Robinhood is required to use your available cash FIRST IS THIS HAPPENING TO EVERYONE No It seems to be sporadic but roughly 50 of the over 1m new accounts that Fidelity opened last week have had margin related restrictions slapped on them because of this issue However one person we talked to had to close his bank account at one of the big three banks because after transferring his Robinhood account they started DEBITING HIS BANK ACCOUNT because they claimed he owed them margin interest MORALE OF THIS STORY Review your account and make sure that your stonks and options when applicable are being held IN CASH if you know you had the cash available to purchase the position Review how much cash is in your RH account If RH says you are holding positions in margin and yet you have cash available to cover those positions then IMMEDIATELY contact Robinhood and insist that your positions be converted to CASH POSITIONS This does not require you to sell your positions Review your statements trade confirmations and account to see if you have been charged margin interest If you used $10k in cash to buy $9 5k in GME stock then you should not see any margin interest charges If you used $10k in cash $5k in margin buying power to buy $15k of GME stock then seeing interest charges makes sense Assuming people find this helpful part 2 will be coming soon ,2021-02-07

A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,29187,l7xj5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/,1581,1611968061.0,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved There is a prevailing mis understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the market price This is false You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order The idealized scenario is that GME rallies Melvin covers and everyone at reddit gets out at the top This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics Melvin will cover before we truly know it and the crash will happen as quick as the rally So with recent events you must ask yourself Who is Your Counterparty Nothing is a sure bet How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is Thousands of redditors new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't exited their trade This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms although their estimates differ some amount Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened It's tough to know for sure Know Everyone's Hand Your guess on how much they've covered and when they covered has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze The difference between the two represents your effective edge Remember we don't actually know Melvin's current position We don't know what's going on behind closed doors We only know the hand they're showing us via media Has their clearing firm taken over Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position Have they been buying since Monday Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath The pot is worth $25 billion dollars Ken Griffin has never lost Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Deutsche are not used to losing well Deutsche is They will do whatever it takes to take the pot from you and leave you holding the bag They will not blink twice because there is a lot of fucking money on the line Know What Can Go Wrong Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week Prepare yourself for the unexpected Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time The stock could be halted for days You could be assigned on ITM options Your stock could get delisted Your stock may get diluted Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose This one is self explanatory Your investment could go to zero Even if you think you make money on every trade if your bet size is 100 the long term value of your portfolio is zero Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital If you are new you really don't know the gut wrenching stomach turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative It fucking sucks You just know the highs You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies wrapped in anti billionaire pro underdog themes It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance We love the feeling If you are fully invested financially emotionally you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price Make feeling good your goal and set limits that you can stomach There are several feel good stories of people making life changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries Please think twice about this and only spend what you can afford to lose If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying you may have a gambling problem These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending Secondly don't take it personal There are people on the other side of your trades your brokerage support line the subreddit the media They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge It's easy to blame a broker yell at their support desk hate tweet at a company or even rage text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade A lot of people across the industry are rooting for you Fuck even Ted Cruz and AOC are rooting for you because this transcends politics If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008 keep it that way They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction brokerages the media and reddit If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers keep it that way Thirdly if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side be a human being for your wallet's sake You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions ,2021-01-30 02:54:21,"8. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.,11110,lj5oyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj5oyo/why_gamestop_and_ryan_cohen_will_win_dd_no/,1526,1613268544.0,Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win DD No Diamond Hands Required Alright apes and autists let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe On November 16 2020 Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers In it Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes The Mission Statement GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology first companies that specialize in gaming products experiences and services The Landscape Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2 5x since the last console cycle The global gaming market expected to be $174 9 billion this year and reach $217 9 billion by 2023 Valuable Assets Existing strong brand and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand increases awareness and strengthens its base Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members Large retail and physical footprint The Roadmap Evolve into a Technology first company Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another GameStop will have to begin building a powerful e commerce platform that provides competitive pricing broad gaming selection fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming GameStop will have to hire the right talent So far Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team more on that later Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors Create a marketplace of wanted products and services i e Amazon Target App Store Provide and expand larger gaming catalogs Capture all games Create community experiences This could be both physical and digital experiences Provide streaming services New vertical opportunity for content creation tournaments and others Support Esports Expanding scene that is not going away Transition to Digital Industry developments in recent years include transition from physical hardware to digital streaming and the explosion of mobile Expand digital content This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam Blizzard App Store etc Allow online trade ins This would be a game changer Cut Excessive costs Cut its excessive real estate costs and identify duplicative under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals Streamline Non core operations in Europe and Australia in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash Near term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future The Financials Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick and mortar business If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports not factored into this calculation for now GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue however it is currently valued at a $3 5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3 3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion Chewy makes roughly $4 8B in Revenue losing money but growing quickly and is valued at $44B in Market Cap Target and Chewy are valued at 1 25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop Obviously this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors but given these metrics GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1 032 a share based on a current revenues Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue If GameStop can grow revenues focus on digital to improve margins and expand within the growing total addressable market I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy like multiples The X Factor I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy Otherwise I do not believe he would have joined the Board In his letter Ryan simply stated that RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten member Board It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model He is hiring digital and e commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession this will be a great opportunity to win Furthermore I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop Digital e commerce streaming and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm but execution will be key Ryan owns nearly 10 of GameStop so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake So degens I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain Strap in and sit tight this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst P S If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves TLDR Ryan Cohen is Jesus Buy and Hold $GME ,2021-02-14 04:09:04,"6. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief Haim Eshed announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a Galactic Federation where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand the fabric of the universe Around this time America's former president Donald Trump established the seventh branch of their military the Space Force Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation He even says that Trump was on the verge of disclosing their existence however he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause mass hysteria due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide COVID 19 and degrading international relationships Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible reliable high ranking and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest ranking officials It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit Not only that but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011 He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that if I had come up with what I’m saying today five years ago I would have been hospitalized In the end he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has nothing to lose I’ve received my degrees and awards Again this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three time recipient of the Israel Security Award Here is the original Jerusalem Post article PLEASE READ Jerusalem Post Article In December of 2017 the New York Times published an article entitled Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’ The Pentagon’s Mysterious U F O Program This article was one of the first publications to give an in depth investigation of the current state of U S intelligence about UFO's unidentified flying objects or UAP's unidentified aerial phenomenons as they are known today by the U S Government In the NYT report it provides evidence to prove the U S Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings According to Defense Department officials included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program AATIP The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012 However when the program's backers were asked about it they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue New York Times Article PLEASE READ One of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U S military aircrafts Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled FLIR1 GIMBAL and GOFAST The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt All three of these videos show cockpit display data infrared imagery and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and impossible aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time One of the fighter pilots Commander David Fravor who was part of the F/A 18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004 had only this to say to the New York Times “I have no idea what I saw It had no plumes wings or rotors and outran our F 18s ” Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as not behaving by the normal laws of physics Furthermore he described the UAP to not be behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move In addition to this bizarreness all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature fumes or even a propulsion system Overall these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community FLIR1 Video Evidence GIMBAL Video Evidence GOFAST Video Evidence Although these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007 as they were being passed around in various website forums It wasn't until September of 2019 when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100 real and recorded by Navy aviators She also added that this was part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years This was one of the first incidences of the U S Government confirming that unknown and physics defying air crafts have entered U S airspace Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative More recently in April of 2021 a new video published by Mystery Wire showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U S Navy destroyer in night vision The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics defying maneuvers Additionally what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were transmedium vehicles meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly Also three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a sphere an acorn and a metallic blimp Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos Susan Gough the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that “I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations ” As you can see this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U S Government is hiding from its citizens Confirmed Pyramid UAP Video Sphere UAP Photo Acorn UAP Photo Metallic Blimp UAP Photo Pentagon Confirmation Article Now you may be asking yourself what happens now Well in last years' gargantuan $2 3 trillion appropriation bill that was mainly for COVID 19 relief aid for millions of Americans contained a rider that was provided by the Senate Intelligence Committee For anyone that doesn't know a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it In this case the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U S Government knowns about UAP's The small provision in the 5 500 page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U S Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a UFO report What do you think I'd love to hear your opinion UFO Disclosure Article While this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest ranking individuals on this planet This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future These events could be increased UFO sightings more government confirmations of UAP encounters or even extraterrestrial contact Overall what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra dimensional beings by the general public Based off human emotion people will not take this news lightly I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns knives and ammunition Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news Additionally there will be a massive pushback against the U S Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off world threat However this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life What I stated above sounds absolutely horrific however our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably it is more of a question of when Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin $LMT Raytheon $RTX and Boeing $BA will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics The final scenario is that the U S military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U S military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government Again whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses Now if you can take one thing from this post it is that information is ESSENTIAL What the U S Government has held from its people is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth we deserve to have this information told to us in full Resources THESE RESOURCES ARE

How to play the upcoming market crash,3027,oe9ruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/,1471,1625499121.0,How to play the upcoming market crash So the market is going to crash harder than a Boeing without updated software soon It doesn't really matter what awesome thing you think you've stumbled onto it's going to go down hard The Fed has put the market on easy mode ever since the COVID crash but that's coming to an end soon So if you don't want to lose all your tendies in the coming storm listen up Oh what's that you say There won't be a market crash Hang on lemme drop a little knowledge on you 1 the RRP numbers RRP is the Reverse Repo Program the fed runs where banks and other institutions park money at the fed overnight in exchange for Treasuries then swap them back the next day This usually spikes at the end of quarters and the rest of the time is super low Over the last few months it's been skyrocketing to all time highs It hit $991 Billion this quarter end then after the Q2 checks ended it fell all the way to $731 Billion Why is this bad It means the banks either need collateral so bad they're putting this much up overnight to get it or they'd rather get an annualized return of 0 05 than anything else at a time when inflation is officially running at around 5 and unofficially as much as twice that This means they the smart money think a guaranteed loss of 4 95 /year is the best they can hope to do 2 The housing market is about to go boom in the bad way Right now we've got increasing prices tons of supply under construction combined with decreasing sales That's basically the perfect indicator of a bubble about to pop Also the end of the eviction moratorium is still waiting around the corner to dump millions of houses on banks that really don't want them and will be very motivated sellers This should have already happened but when Team Sleepy Biden got a look at the amount of doom coming they quickly punted the ball and emergency extended the eviction moratorium by another month to the end of July Kick that can all you want it's still there and just getting bigger 3 The commercial housing market is basically in the same place today as the residential market was in 2008 and banks are loaded to the tits with bad CMBS products If you're confused how this could happen again only a few years later it's pretty simple all the guys who did the MBS nonsense in '08 didn't face any penalties so they moved over to CMBS and started inflating the income of the businesses renting properties Now what has the pandemic done more than anything else Killed the small businesses and retail stores that make up the majority of tenants in said CMBS loans So you've got a bunch of companies that Amazon just put out of business not paying their rent anymore which means the places they were paying rent to are no longer paying their mortgage Combine that with many companies reducing their office footprints with hybrid work from home setups and CMBS go BOOM in the bad way 4 The signs they are the everywhere Every company that can is going public right now regardless of whether they make money or not This is one of those classic the top is in signs Retail is fomoing into the market in a big way Remember the line about how a guy knew the market was done when his shoeshine boy had stock tips Now it's your Uber driver and Pizza delivery guy 5 Margin debt is around $860 billion right now And that's just what's disclosed Remember Bill Hwang lost $20 billion and even more for Credit Suisse and Deutsche and Nomura Yeah none of that leverage was disclosed because it was all in swaps You think he's the only family office out there pulling stunts like that And don't even get me started on how much margin is tied up in the funny internet money Hell Binance lets people margin at 100 to 1 That's beyond insane So yeah huge amounts of margin mean whenever things take a turn for the worse they spiral really really fast 6 When in doubt zoom out We've had people posting hundred year and twenty year charts and the stock markets channel for months now They all show the top of the channel that makes the bad bounce down happen is being touched Elliot Waves and other kinds of TA all show the same thing we're about to go down way downtown like 1929 down 7 All time highs but 50 of stocks are under their 50 day moving average That's happened in six of the last seven trading days It's never happened in history more than 3 out of 5 days before and every single time was shortly followed by a massive massive crash The crash has already started for the smaller fish but the indexes are being propped up by the big names because money is de risking by fleeing to them hoping they'll survive 8 Student loans The moratorium ends on September 30 Meaning that in October all of a sudden the people most likely to spend money in the economy young mid to low level disposable income will see that spending ability completely wiped out all at once This is tens of millions of Americans who immediately won't be spending money at businesses And you know what the most common month for financial crashes is October which is right after September Finally you don't just have to take my word for it Here's a list of some prominent financial types calling for doom soon 1 Dr Michael J Burry 2 a whole bunch of other assholes who don't have his track record but are echoing it So how you do make money on the collapse of the market Don't try to pick companies and buy puts if you do that you have to root on stuff failing Buy calls on SPXS SQQQ and SDOW then you get to root for things going up I don't do posts very often but my first DD on the oil markets made a whole lot of you a bunch of money Here's another chance to do it again Positions 10x HYG 7/23 80p 10x SPXS 7/16 40c 10x SPXS 7/16 55c Honestly I don't know if these will print or not But on the day they expire I'll just roll them or buy more another month or two out and will continue to do so If you want to just buy and forget Jan 2022 calls are the safest thing I can think of Maybe this can gets kicked out past the summer but there is no way it makes it past this fall and the student loan spending cliff EDIT and TLDR Market go boom in bad way Bet against market to make tendies Money printer no work no more printed too much money make liquidity trap RRP evidence of liquidity overload EDIT2 First a lot of people in the comments don't like my positions I've had them for awhile and they have a very good chance to expire worthless but as I said I'll keep rolling them because I did the math and it's cheaper to keep rolling them than to just buy Jan 2022 calls The options markets prices don't make sense a lot of the time so I really recommend doing the math on buying calls and puts at various points instead of just blindly picking a date and rolling with it Second the banks are being propped up by bullshit For those of you who didn't know the stress test they recently passed a couple weeks ago so they could start issuing dividends It used data from October 9 2020 That's fucking insane There's an interview with the head of BofA where he's talking about something else and mentions completely unprompted assuming we pass the stress test and he looked stressed as fuck while saying it There's no way on god's green earth that Bill Hwang was the only one being as fucky with hidden leverage like swaps or who knows what in the funny money markets with things like tokenized stocks to hide naked

there are a bunch of goddamn icebergs out there EDIT 3 since I've been getting some questions about what's wrong with the banks and the CMBS market here are two articles one from the Atlantic last summer and one from the Intercept published in April An excerpt from the Intercept piece In a study released last November they sampled almost 40 000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019 “Overall ” they write “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5 or more in 28 of loans ” This was just the average however Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS Goldman Sachs Citigroup and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse “having more than 35 of their loans exhibiting 5 or greater income overstatement ” This is just the same thing as the NINJA No Income No Job Application for residential mortgages in 2008 applied to commercial loans EDIT 4 Since I'm getting a lot of requests both in comments and DMs about it here is a follow up post that explains exactly what the fuck is wrong with the housing market and why it's going to

Why Sentiment Has Turned Against You I want you to understand this Truly I like GameStop I like $GME I believe in the long term plan or what I/we think is the plan anyway I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case which they barely even pretend to have considered I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck My personal belief which I require nobody else to share is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do and their buying alone will drive the price up But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price or they'd have done so I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares That's what I believe and why I'm not holding positions right now I probably will in the future but my personal opinion is the time is not right I wrote these posts EDIT lol I just realized both of those posts aren't visible since they were removed by the mods They were pro retail and pro GME I want to see people make money on this Better yet I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS Further what Robinhood did as well as Webull Interactive Brokers E Trade EToro and tons of other brokerages did was fucked up Everybody here agrees But you guys are actually fucking insane We dont have a problem with the stock We have a problem with YOU Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing And that's okay But the new people 7 million new versus 1 5 million old have done the following Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME AMC BB and NOK Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots While you've realized there were bots that were bought you missed probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas that the bots were spamming NOK Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier I saw one person disagreeing with a long time and well respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist Short ladders Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder EVERY TIME You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days With zero understanding of market mechanics explaining to others why price action is fake Look how low volume is on this candle It's not a real drop the dip is fake Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 paperhand pussies for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1 500 Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum Denying Reality S3 partners is not lying to you They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult to obtain information on short interest Just because they're reporting that short of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you Spammed low effort memes and easily Googleable questions on the new submissions When your posts were taken down you posted AGAIN Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position I want to gag every time I see somebody write I'm not a financial advisor following a post that makes that very clear Moving the goalposts YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph We finished above $325 Gamma squeeze Personal confession I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day Ok we fell another 50 Tuesday but definitely Wednesday Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done which is remove shit tier posts from the front page which you then posted again and again Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit Market Manipulation No Pump Dumps pressuring other people to buy low float stocks such as GME so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam Political Bullshit If you think it's not about the money then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money No Bullshitting There are so many of you advising others on their trades followed by This is not financial advice am ape while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about but OP misinterpreted the meaning Believe it or not that's against the rules Just say you dont know Or say nothing There's actually no need to spam Gain Loss Posts nobody wants to see your Loss on one third of a share of AMC Come on YOLO Your investment in one third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55 000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die not a fucking YOLO it's a

amongst yourselves that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill Do you think that's a healthy mindset If this is the investment that you truly want to make and you feel you have an understanding of the risks then fucking let it rip I hope it works out Seriously I want you to make money I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn But

explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation Good morning everyone this is an important update to what happened yesterday x200B First of all I made a prediction in my post yesterday The prediction would've become reality if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares more about that in a second Why do I tell you this I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended Just a heads up Those are PREDICTIONS they can be faulty at times especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things that no Data can predict again more about that in a second So please for the love of god don't harass me insult me or send me death threats when something like that happens I understand your frustration but don't target me x200B Now the juicy stuff What exactly happened yesterday Here is a timeline x200B 9 35 AM The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume Hedgefunds shorted over 18 363 000 Shares over the first 5 minutes The amount of shorting was so aggressive that trading got halted twice within the first minutes 9 45 AM TO 1 50 PM Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time people kept buying in we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that 1 55PM Shit gets interesting Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126 At that point in time between 5 000 000 and 7 000 000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye What stood out for me at that point in time is that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack between $100 and $125 That tells me it was really important to get the price down in that direction more in a few seconds 2PM TO 3 25PM People buying in again driving the price up to $140 $150 And Now shit gets juicy 3 30PM TO 4 00PM The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes until the market closes 10 000 000 shares were shorted in this time span NOW THE ANALYSIS WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE So how could no one forsee this It's simple Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short they created them out of thin air When the market opened yesterday ALL available $GME Shares to borrow were gone already see my second edit from yesterday EDIT2 10AM 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW THEY BORROWED OVER 2 100 000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY What does this mean Well no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now because they are not using real shares to short GME They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious If we add up the three big short attacks 18 363 000 right at opening 5 000 000 to 7 000 000 at noon and about 10 000 000 right before close we get 33 363 000 shares sold short over the day Why is this funny and obvious Check the latest FINRA report It states that yesterday more than 33 000 000 were sold short That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES Because bears are fuk See when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150 over 44 000 Call options would've become ITM If exercised that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds maybe even thousands Why is that so bad The higher the price gets the more calls get exercised so called options chain the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore Even when all the data available states that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS You know what they say There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore That's what we're seeing right now No one can give accurate predictions anymore that is based on data This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days IN SHORT BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES x200B TL DR Hedgies are so fucked that they just shorted GME with more than 33 000 000 non existent shares yesterday keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening The price would've jumped up to a few hundred maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it which would've started the real squeeze today They have nothing to lose anymore so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips x200B EDIT 1PM EUROPEAN TIME According to this site the short sale volume was 61 percent yesterday with a short sale volume of 50 959 384 That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33 000 000 If it's more than that even better x200B EDIT2 TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS HERE IS A GREAT READ Quote Naked Short — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares In the context of this document a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company is considered counterfeit This is not a legal conclusion since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud Returning to our example everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC Without a borrowed share behind the short sale a naked short is really a counterfeit share x200B EDIT3 9 30AM THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS x200B EDIT4 How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares It is possible that some retail traders sold but if you take a look at the Short volume 61 yesterday with 51 000 000 shares being sold short and then take a look at the overall sell volume it doesn't add up If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 short volume the price drop would've been much much bigger Most retail held through therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting because no one was selling x200B EDIT5 I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place ALMOST certain but I don't want to make false promises so please take it with a grain of salt because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date If I am able to finish it today I'll link it here as well This actually feels like a conspiracy theory because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true x200B Another edit to blueball you guys even more The crazy last minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight Again connecting to that specific date But that's just a theory a Game stop theory Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is x200B UPDATE I HAVE ALL THE DATA YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW 3PM EST / 9PM CET x200B I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post If I made some mistakes or missed

squeeze",22623,leorks,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/,1358,1612741249.0,Evidence points to GME Shorts not having covered but pretending they did via the use of options to illegally cover with synthetic long shares to break the squeeze Long post ahead but I encourage you to read the whole thing This is a re post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned I am re posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared particularly at this junction in time If you've seen this post before I would appreciate an upvote for visibility TLDR Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered specifically an illegal method/loophole to cover their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options Full details below There’s an insightful piece on TradeSmithDaily that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling driving the price down further releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels From TradeSmithDaily Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price in other words could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills and the longs were selling early giving the shorts a means to cover as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time because without a critical mass of long side holders selling into the market the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze ” From TradeSmithDaily The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market The tactics involved are not a secret In fact the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC knows all about such tactics and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013 The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close out Obligations ” You can read it here via the SEC website The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language but here’s a quick rundown If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options having sold the call options to someone else typically a market maker — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade This works because if a market maker buys options from an options writer the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function This is necessary under the current rules and the current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades As a result of the above transaction the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts legally initiated by the market maker so the market maker can hedge The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund It gets very complicated very fast But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered and can’t for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays market maker naked shorting exceptions and legal practices of synthetic share creation new longs and shorts made from thin air relating to market making Below is a section of the SEC memo from page 8 that gets to the heart of it “Trader A may enter a buy write transaction consisting of selling deep in the money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale By doing so Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker dealer’s close out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion In practice however the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares and is instead re establishing or extending a fail position ” In short no pun intended these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that legally speaking they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located” Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares and Michael Burry’s now deleted tweet viewable here about how when he called back shares he lent out brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located To summarize it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand If this is true and there are signs that it is this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely This inspires a thought experiment if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a 500 to 5000 loss when prices were at 300 400 last week when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions The saying for stocks goes its only a loss when you sell The version for shorts would be its only a loss if you close out your short positions Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts here and here now a pastebin originally a popular post from a reddit user that present the argument that mathematically speaking shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions Based on this logic if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions In addition one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up Instead during this past week when shorts supposedly covered price of the stock somehow went into a free fall Why Something to think about I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March screenshot from a WSB post In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover What can retail investors do in that case Two thoughts come to mind A One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position If you care about forcing the issue you can follow the instructions here B Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation which you can do at Sidenote On the subject of synthetic long shares another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest calculations last week from a short interest from on 122 on 1/28 Thursday to 113 on 1/29 Friday to 55 on 1/31 Sunday which many found to be suspicious Later it was discovered that number of 55 was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113 short interest percentage but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the new short interest percentage of 55 and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior and if so to what degree is something to consider If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side For example hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real time short interest percentage A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves but while this report is a data point the data in the report will still be two weeks old With that said examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay retarded longer than funds can stay solvent The paper hand sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement To explore it from a different perspective if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient case in point being the retail sell off when the price started dropping At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze If you know your enemies and know yourself you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation calculated and continuous shorting short ladder attacks read this and this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares' which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts can be used to ladder attack the stock price which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play and other potential methods If his forces are united separate them aka divide and conquer Upon driving weak hands to sell off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some paper hands who then spread their views and further the divide Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division I will leave you with that and a reminder to do your own research for as investors we do not have all the information available and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion once brought to awareness would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further If you agree with the ideas explored in this post feel free to share with whomever

potential to DESTROY all the hedge funds that shorted GME and change the ENTIRE Financial system forever disrupting the clearinghouses themselves I have to start his post that I am retarded and that this is not financial advice you all here do your own research and make your own decisions all I know is that I LIKE THE STOCK x200B 💎🙌🚀🚀 TLDR at the bottom 🚀🚀💎🙌 x200B I do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 9 58 AM and that we almost crashed the entire thing There was a post here describing a 30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb In this post they described and expressed their outrage with the Interactive Brokers Chairman interview THEY ARE CORRECT There was ANOTHER interview with Anthony Denier CEO of Webull that I did not see that received as much attention here In this interview it is a bit longer must watch imo It explains some of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with Vlad from Robinhood and what happened in general It confirms that 1 THEY HAD A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM 2 THE SHORTS ARE STARTING TO GO BUST 3 THE BROKERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO GET SHARES THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANT GET 4 THE BROKERS THEMSELVES CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS PROPERLY 5 THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO CANNOT COVER AND ARE GETTING LOANS FROM THE BANKS DUE TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS x200B Essentially we liked the stock so much 🚀🚀🚀 that the shorties all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron blew up so fast that the BROKERS could not properly margin call them in time THEY COULD NOT LIQUIDATE THEM IN TIME TO GET THEM TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS IN TIME Now the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot THIS is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening But we BLEW past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the 🌈🐻 now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you Since these brokers are large they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves As Thomas Peterffy flexes that he has billions to cover When I heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses Then it hit me THEY CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS These brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them The clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account They usually have about 1 2 of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction HOWEVER for GME it is raised to a 100 THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT SETTLE THESE TRANSACTIONS Once Robinhood's clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through Webull's clearing house I belive it is Apex that they use They almost IMMEDIATELY had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions THEY STARTED TAKING LOANS FROM BANKS TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HALTING THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTIONS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STOCK TO GO AROUND At this point what that all means is that THERE IS not enough stock to go around and the LOSES of these 🌈🐻 are so LARGE that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do And their CLEARING HOUSE cannot do it either THIS IS WHY THEY STOPPED YOU FROM BUYING BUT ALLOWED SELLING They used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHORT LADDER ATTACK The most beautiful thing happened EVERYONE HELD From Luis Rossmann's Video 6 18 Bid vs Ask price difference is massive Look at that difference between BID and ASK I love ALL of you You all 💎🙌 that shit so hard x200B You yes YOU reading this because you 💎🙌 that shit the price did not drop further Because of every single one of you they were not able to cover their positions x200B What this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy 🌈🐻 hedge fund 🌈🐻 managers but also THE BROKERS THE CLEARING HOUSES and the WHOLE THING x200B Now this all means that we are very very VERY close to winning At this point IF we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today it will be 15million 20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause the SQUEEZE to the moon 🚀 x200B At this point I plan to hold and you should too If we keep drying out these clearing houses brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely The more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution x200B x200B TLDR The brokers have let their 🌈🐻 clients🌈🐻 lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares The losses are so large that THEY the BROKER are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SHARES because of the capital requirements for GME and they are borrowing from the banks This is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market Buy them out and then buy on brokers like Fidelity that do not have a clearing house This is why they stopped allowing GME to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses Everyone here managed to 💎🙌 so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the BID/ASK price to increase drastically I am buying and holding 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀GME to the moon 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀 I have 15 shares $40 44 not much I know but I am gonna reload asap and I am planning to sell 10 20 at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $42 069 69/share x200B EDIT I should have made it more clear for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like Fidelity ,2021-01-29 19:50:03,"7. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,12041,lglrg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1345,1612959657.0,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together TLDR Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME and if true was likely aided by DTCC whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226 and later in the range of 150 percent of total float Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example Where do these shares come from One potential explanation is synthetic long shares created via a loophole described here or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting I’m an entrepreneur not a finance expert so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject I started with this “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver For example human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book entry form thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three day settlement period A fail may also result from “naked” short selling ” Interesting We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox “Abusive naked short sales can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price to the detriment of all of its investors The Commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three day settlement period is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws … We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities Specifically these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership voting lending and dividends from issuers Moreover they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price Source In a different speech Mr Cox re iterated that short selling helps prevent irrational exuberance and bubbles But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it ” Mr Cox also “referred to the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “ a tool to drive down a company's stock price and that the SEC is concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO which reminds me of this piece I wrote source for SEC Chairman’s words As another datapoint Robert J Shapiro former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1 000 companies into the ground Source This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008 I also read ‘ One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books This has been alleged to create phantom or counterfeit shares sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares and artificially depressing the share price’ ” Shortly after I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers Taibbi said that the two firms got a push into extinction from a flat out counterfeiting scheme called naked short selling Source All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen potentially even an infinite short squeeze On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre trading started the stock shot up to 513 in pre trading and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling followed by several other brokers Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying but funds were not When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2 5 billion to Melvin Capital one of the short side funds and is also responsible for something like 40 of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself Now personally speaking its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this However looking into the details of what happened a skeptical part of me became suspicious Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening On that day there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag Worse DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts From an article dating back to 2007 “Depository Trust Clearing Corp is a little known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers About 99 of the time trades are completed without incident But about 1 of the shares valued at about $2 5 billion on a given a day aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days for one reason or another These failures to deliver have put DTCC in the middle of a long running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices ” Source Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time According to Wall Street Journal “ There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens The fight is over how prevalent the problem is and the extent to which DTCC is responsible Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern ” Source It has been alleged in tens or hundreds of lawsuit s that the DTCC and its Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds Law suits have been brought against Merrell Lynch Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley JP Morgan UBS other market makers and also the DTCC The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases The information that they do release is incomplete self serving and misleading Source As a thought experiment lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME many many indicators point to this and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces Something to consider Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day From the Wall Street Journal “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice The latest move came last month when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale But some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough … Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months Until that failure is resolved there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account critics say This phantom stock can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked shorting problem ” source From everything I’ve seen as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26 many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented I personally hold the following hypothesis GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221 and 150 at various times and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122 GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering which is illegal to cover using this particular method and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed With the hearing coming up on February 18th I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing as well as your own district representatives and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing l They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares failed to deliver their complicity in naked shorting and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28 Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing Alexandria Ocasio Cortez email us ocasiocortez com mailto us ocasiocortez com Al Green email al green mail house gov mailto al green mail house gov Maxine Waters email maxine waters mail house gov mailto maxine waters mail house gov Nancy Pelosi Email email sf nancy mail house gov mailto sf nancy mail house gov And you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to Edit Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss Even if you've read it before recommend reading it again Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true Prime brokers are likely complicit Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC This brings up another interesting thought experiment On 1/28 when the price was 450 and shorts were likely under 100 if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME then when the squeeze was about to happen or happening if brokers margin called the shorts they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag By that logic they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think mostly likely happened Edit 2 A compelling theory put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs recommend giving it a read Edit 3 If you want to read more in depth about counterfeiting stock this is a good place to start ,2021-02-10

Them,15984,o4s1yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4s1yv/market_manipulation_50_heres_how_market_makers/,1344,1624299843.0,Market Manipulation 5 0 Here's how Market Makers keep you Losing Money on Stocks that Seem Good and Safe using Social Media You Are Helping Them The Definition Of Market Manipulation Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain Investopedia According to most retail investors this means that market manipulation is when an entity with a huge portfolio that buys or sells a large amount of stock can cause large price movements This is one type of market manipulation but not what I want to talk about today x200B How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What's Happening Today Richard D Wyckoff Who Is Wyckoff Richard Demille Wyckoff 1873–1934 was an early 20th century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market He is considered one of the five “titans” of technical analysis along with Dow Gann Elliott and Merrill At age 15 he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage Afterwards while still in his 20s he became the head of his own firm He also founded and for nearly two decades wrote and edited The Magazine of Wall Street which at one point had more than 200 000 subscribers Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets as well as an active tape reader and trader He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore From his observations and interviews with those big time traders Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws principles and techniques of trading methodology money management and mental discipline Why I'm Including it in This Post From his position Mr Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced Consequently he dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played by the large interests or “smart money ” In the 1930s he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players His time tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated Basically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation Who Is The Composite Man “…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations Let us call him the Composite Man who in theory sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it and to your great profit if you do understand it ” The Richard D Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique section 9 p 1 2 Based on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators Wyckoff taught that 1 The Composite Man carefully plans executes and concludes his campaigns 2 The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a “broad market ” 3 One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it 4 With study and practice one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them The Importance Of Liquidity Let's say a stock is sitting at $20 but a Pro thinks it could make it to be worth $40 large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares Once they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before they can't unload everything at once or they would affect the market again But how can they unload their shares at maximum profit Through manipulation They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple and they manipulate the newspapers to do it FOMO They create FOMO Fear Of Missing Out in small retail investors and that brings a lot of volume on that stock If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation you're wrong Consider an institutional investor who bought 5 000 000 shares of a company at $1 that now sits at $3 has a lot more information about that company than you do and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you're offering so how can he dump 5 000 000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it He's going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up that he's going to make a 500 move and you're going to miss out People start FOMOing and bring huge volume to that stock with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible He doesn't care if the stock makes a 100 move in the meantime because of this sudden interest he only cares about getting out And guess what later on when the bad news is released the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned x200B “You have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend or some very bullish news appears in print This is not mere accident The whole move is manufactured Its purpose is to make money for inside interests — those who are operating in the stock in a large way And this can only be done by fooling the public or by inducing the public to fool themselves ” This was written in 1930 90 Years ago Buy the rumour sell the news Market Manipulation 5 0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen After what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good x200B What is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are The problem is that many people trust other DDs Due Diligence too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks What's worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start propagandizing when they see that they are losing money x200B Basically what is happening is that I and probably you too am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at $10 because it is full of potential pumped by a market maker and when they find themselves owning it with a 30 loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research If you don't know how to research ask the person who posted the sources How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks Don't trust anyone do your own research Ask for sources from those who publish DDs Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away Don't buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming example stock X will get FDA approval next week usually won't and will fall into oblivion If you're losing on a stock stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it you can't just buy and forget about it If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock SELL THE NEWS Conclusion English is not my first language I hope I have expressed myself correctly I used information from StockCharts and Financial Post I know this is a different post than the average one here so I hope you enjoyed it If you

Explanation for noobs who don't quite understand what's going on...,13228,l6kgik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kgik/explanation_for_noobs_who_dont_quite_understand/,1331,1611826375.0,Explanation for noobs who don't quite understand what's going on Mods does DD tag apply If not change it I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply So they're betting against the company Like they have no faith in them Investing like this makes one feel horrible Yeah There are three ways you can short 1 You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price depending on how much you want to pay determines the price If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months you might buy a $9 10 month expiry put right to sell at price option This might cost you 50c per share IF you're even slightly right ie it drops to any price lower than $8 49 before expiry you made 1c per share You can also change your mind and sell the option either more profit or less loss than 50c/share IF you're properly right and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3 5 per share If it rises or drops to any number above $8 50 you lose the price of the option 50c/share 2 You're a big player You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x interest and return them to you later A set timeframe may be set I don't know for sure but probably Anyhow Pension Fund X42 says ok because they aren't looking to sell them so might as well make some interest on lending them So you borrow them and immediately sell them You pay your daily interest to the pension fund and you wait When the price drops and you decide that you've made enough you buy them back and return them You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be minus the interest If you're wrong You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42 So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back 3 You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking you Naked Short Sell This is great because it's cheaper No interest payments Here you simply sell shares you don't have and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3 I'm sure there is a bit of 1 but 1 only causes predictable losses Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're obliged to buy back the shares at some point if they go up when you have to quit you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more Now you're in a short squeeze You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else So the price goes higher Your losses are potentially infinite What's slightly different between this particular short squeeze and all the others is 1 The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40 more shares than ever existed They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible The only way out of that self made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying returning rebuying from the people you borrowed them from and returning them with losses at every step Imagine if I sold you 10 cars but only delivered 6 You're standing there with your wtf face and I say Hey how much would you sell those 4 cars for You can name your price at this point I pay it Then I finish my 10 car delivery 2 Retail traders are acting as one single semi coordinated hive loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes be a competitor hedge fund They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds HFs NEED to buy but they're not selling They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it 2a HFs can be negotiated with If you're really really getting bent over and fucked and you grovel enough you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you If they won't talk to you they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day You quit this and we'll owe you one It's always good to have favours to call 2b The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with They don't need favours They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage They don't give a fuck about any of them For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max and also for the most part they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two How do you negotiate with or swat a million wasps stinging you You can't Edit Thanks for all the awards guys I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your Яetard Prince for the day I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't I'd like to thank the academy and my parents who never believed in me and Scruffy my first dog who like WSB played chicken with truck and and and Also I figure since this is so popular I might as well nominate my suggestion for the inevitable u/deepfuckingvalue movie It's fairly likely to be seen as a sequel to the Wolf of Wall St so The Fox/Foxes of Main Street Yeah nah Edit 2 NOTE To all the people trying to PM me for advice I have no fucking idea what WILL happen next I just think I cobbled together enough of what HAS happened to explain it somewhat Ie I'm more like a journalist Would you ask a journalist for stock advice please don't answer yes ,2021-01-28 11:32:55,"3.

GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research & analysis.,7089,lteecj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/,1329,1614422692.0,GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market I did some research analysis Before I start I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism Hypothesis GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market New York Stock Exchange NYA Market Cap $22 9 trillion 2400 stock listings Nasdaq IXIC Market Cap 3300 listings S P 500 MC $31 61 trillion Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA Market Cap $8 33 trillion 30 largest of NYA and Nasdaq TLDR /Abstract I compare the relationship between GME and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship As GME rises the market responds by dropping Based on this data my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market If this data is accurate then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just GME indicators but also prospective market strategies/positions In short when GME goes up the market goes down TLDR for data I found that the NYA DJIA and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME NYA NYA p 0027 DJIA p 0018 Nasdaq p 0 88 START I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result However whenever I mentioned this idea I’ve been met with opposition so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above x200B GME DJIA IXIC NYA YTD DATA If you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price Meaning while the whole market collapses GME rises The opposite is also true as GME drops the rest of the market rises The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested PROCESS I calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME NYA DJIA IXIC All data can be found there x200B Covariance Correlation Matrices P values Statistically significant values highlighted The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA For those that are not into statistics the p value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance” It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance Any p value less than 05 is considered statistically significant A p value less than 05 basically says that there is less than a 5 chance that the relationships are due to “luck” As you can see there is a 27 chance that the NYA dropping is random and a 18 chance for the DJIA While the IXIC does not fit the bill I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC or when comparing DJIA to IXIC So what does this mean My opinions To me this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber rich but rather a battle for the entire market On January 26 the DJIA dropped 600 points the IXIC 300 points and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars At this point you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top 10 own 88 of the ENTIRE market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted it's theirs My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market Final thoughts/ Disclaimers Anyway this is just something I wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything None of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it I would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there I also want to clarify that this was based on limited YTD data I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff If anyone has access to quality data I would love to sink my teeth into it I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR Edit Wow I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community Thank you all so much I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality Correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable In a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the P test The P test essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between 2 variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck If you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant For instance vitamin b 12 claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no In layman's terms the p test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided there is a 27 chance that the two are UNRELATED or a 99 73 chance they are related In the scientific community anything below 5 or less than 05 is considered statistically significant Also I didn't just test correlation I also tested covariance Covariance is not the same as correlation Covariance measures the direction of the relationship In this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship Meaning when one goes up the other one goes down So with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship Apart from that it does not say why or how they related That is purely speculation and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data I am not convincing you to buy into mine Lastly I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of 500 dollars per data set Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it Other than that Thank you all so much for the support and awards Edit 2 The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility u/big boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA He got a correlation coefficient of 0 53 which is close to mine of 0 49 u /big boolean Graph For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post post your results and I will add them on For reference I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations Edit 3 I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in depth understanding of applied statistics than I do To all of you experts I welcome your criticism Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better Pointing out problems/faults is important but providing actionable solutions even more so ,2021-02-27 12:44:52,"3. {""GME"":

possible and we can make history Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV a follow up from my shorter post a few hours ago First things first don't do this until the GME rise is done Lets conquer one market at a time I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after Then again each person is an individual and that needs to be made clear as well If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end I present 2 investment DDs in this post the short squeeze and the fundamentals If you want to see what to buy The short squeeze Buy SLV shares and call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100 1 and 500 1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver but lets call it 250 1 for now This means that for every 250 ounces in open interest in the futures market only 1 actually gets delivered Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade its JP Morgan Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much but this simply isn't the case here The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world Real commodities are being traded and if you are short you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it If you remember oil going negative back in May that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value but there is very little physical silver actually readily available think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery with very little available to actually buy They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule The fundamentals The current gold to silver ratio is 73 1 Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver Naturally occurring silver is only 18 75 times as common as gold so this ratio of 73 1 is quite high Until the early 20th century silver prices were pegged at a 15 1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then In terms of current production the ratio is even lower at 8 1 Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years but now their silver vaults are empty At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0 24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil This 0 24 billion ounces represents only 8 of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally This means that 92 of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house Also with silver at $23 an ounce currently this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used as I have mentioned $70 billion sounds like a lot but we don’t have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot If the squeeze happens it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust but it is spread very thin Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper This means that even as the silver price skyrockets it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced Even if new mines were to be constructed it could take years to come online Finally most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment It is used in electronics solar panels and jewelry for the most part This demand wont go away if the silver price rises so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in driving demand for silver The $1 9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself x200B What to buy I will be putting 50 directly into SLV shares and 50 into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16 This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35 Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if we pull this off Alternate options buying physical silver this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay going long futures for February or March if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem We need actual physical delivery which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery miners I don’t recommend buying miners as part of this trade Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market Furthermore most silver miners only derive 30 50 of their revenue from silver anyways so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage Details on SLV physical settlement When SLV issues shares the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily From the SLV prospectus An investment in Shares is Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust The Trustee’s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1 100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form The bulk of the Trust’s silver holdings is represented by physical silver identified on the Custodian’s or if applicable sub custodian's books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future Join me brothers Lets take silver to the moon and take on the biggest and baddest manipulators in the world Please post rocket emojis in the comments as desired Disclaimer do your own research make your own decisions everything here is a guess and hypothetical and nothing is guaranteed not a financial advisor I have ADHD and maybe other things too Bear case silver does tend to sell off if the broader market plunges so it’s not immune to broad market sell off It’s also the most manipulated market in the world so we are facing some tough competition on the short side,2021-01-28 14:14:36,"2. {""SLV"": ""Rise"", ""GME"": ""Rise""}"

GME - It's all coming together,22166,mqd3o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqd3o5/gme_its_all_coming_together/,1316,1618381487.0,GME It's all coming together Apes I come to you as a fellow primate with excellent news my wife finally left me Now I have her boyfriend all to myself Before I reading I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences so please don't comment that these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research so do not take them as fact This is not financial advice I am not a financial advisor There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future The news Amazon Chewey Execs being appointed RC being named god of the board GME announcing the search for new C E O GME paying off senior notes today The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3 5M shares or $1B in value this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting 6/9 lmao Why it matters The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares When GME made this announcement the stock was at $190 GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens the market would react negatively to the stock and because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting that negative reaction could've been huge Despite knowing this they decided not to sell at that moment I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190 they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so With that being said I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190 If this wasn't their plan then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock which it did Finally when almost every analyst boomers says that GME is grossly overvalued it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher Therefore I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock To add to this GME has repeatedly warned in their S E C filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze they have said this twice since the original squeeze This to me seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought again just a theory Catalyst But what could the next announcement be It's very difficult to actually know The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C E O position or the digital transformation GME could very well announce Cohen as the C E O which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e commerce Again this is simply conjecture but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price However the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall First I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares only individual investors can do that If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears oh wait If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall that could be the ultimate catalyst for us Or if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares see my previous DD on that Personally I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon but I guess not Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep Timing The timing on the possible above mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect First our lord and savior Mr Gill's calls expire this Friday At the same time GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume pictured below The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways As many of you know the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap time for some chaos Finally we have the 4/20 lmao deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because as I said previously they have a vested interest in getting this above $190 Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch x200B Finally I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY which seems to be true but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad but GME moves when the market is volatile which usually happens when the market is bad And oh would you look at that SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 pre pandemic levels Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility For more on this I encourage you to read the everything short post which provides a much more in depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that Here are the charts The first one is VIX and the second is SPY both are the purple lines as you can see the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions As stated previously the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change The thing to get from this is that based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low Quick Note on Short interest Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19 50 which is still extremely high Most apes say that it's over 100 at minimum I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting naked shorting and synthetic longs see other posts for more on this Therefore I believe that the true short interest is over 100 It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2 with short interest being able 20 and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today Also based purely on logic it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50 Therefore I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious Conclusion So we have technicals lining up very nicely a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now a plethora of potential catalysts a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled abusive shorting a failure to deliver cycle an insanely volatile stock that loves good news a market that is thirsty for some volatility and oh year one more thing some damn primates that refuse to sell Stay strong apes ,2021-04-14 09:24:47,"4. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

the GME chart looks like this Shitadel Max Pain Theory x200B Image is copied from one of u /chayse1984's posts Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason and it's not all Brownian Motion you stochastic cucks So we got two big fucking triangles up here but do you even know why Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday dipshits Okay let me tell you a story It's 2002 Young high flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck you money wasn't enough for him So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a Market Maker This was the start of Shitadel Securities the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet Almost immediately following its conception Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket Around this time MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time And boy does Shitadel an options MM nonetheless have an appetite for risk Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an Investment Bank the king of Chicago But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry Devastated For the first time in Kenny's padded cushiony life he faces what still isn't real hardship Too uncool for the club it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities aha get it on retail investors Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with Payment for Order Flow a practice pioneered by none other than Bernie Madoff E Trade TD Ameritrade Charles Schwab Ally Invest First Trade TradeStation Interactive Brokers Lite and yes Robinhood all contract with Shitadel for PFOF It's with a heavy heart that I tell you even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest internalizer in finance Oh for fucks sakes what the hell is an internalizer now At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us right In PFOF your order is sent from whatever discount brokerage you're using to Shitadel Securities who decides to either A pass your order onto the open market where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B to take the other side of your order short whatever you long or long whatever you short at which point the life of your order ends never making it to the open market You heard me right When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood your order may never land on the open market But this is fine right Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security the stock price on the open market wouldn't move there would be no volume on the open market and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing and massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position Okay but in order for Shitadel to do this they would need to be a monopoly right From https / / Okay but if Shitadel were to do this their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange and drive the price up before Shitadel right An obvious short attack https / /markets businessinsider com /news /stocks /gamestop stock price trading halts volatility spike 176 trading range 2021 3 1030170445 Okay okay But why would Shitadel do this Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of Impact Cost Remember how Shitadel Securities is an options MM Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays It's my opinion that Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this If the price jumps out of their control not only do they lose money on all their shorts they also lose money on all their options If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS Boom x200B P S Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this Max Pain Theory Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this Buy leaps on Fridays like these and sell not buy weeklies during bull flags like this x200B Tldr Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless If enough people realize this and lay on

$GME: How the Dip today was due to ETF shares being lent out (Over 3.5Million) DD,18549,m5zoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/,1229,1615893177.0,$GME How the Dip today was due to ETF shares being lent out Over 3 5Million DD Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2 month old dog Also due to wsb guidelines i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap Please bear with me not the 🐻🌈 Anyone questions Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10 15 working days jk Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly Exchange Traded Funds ETF An exchange traded fund ETF is a type of security that tracks an index sector commodity or another asset but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds Short Selling Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own but have instead borrowed likely from a brokerage Most people short sell shares for two reasons 1 They expect the share price to decline Short sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit 2 They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security For example if you have sold a put option an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security Authorized Participants An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund ETF They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market authorized participants create more Likewise as ETF borrow costs increase APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position and more likely to fail to deliver In a typical transaction the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102 to 105 of the shares' value in cash government securities or a bank letter of credit If the ETF needs to sell the stock it can recall it from the borrower But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF $GME relationship Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors x200B Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze x200B By law a fund can have no more than one third of its total assets in securities on loan Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF and redeeming others and getting the underlying securities in return so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates Because the supply isn't fixed there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short industry participants say The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending Suspicious isn't it Credit to u/hkzor for providing these images x200B x200B ETF 1 6 5M available last week to 4M today x200B x200B ETF 2 1 3M available last week to 850k today x200B x200B ETF 3 900k last week to 500k today Just taking into account Three ETF lendings you could see 3 35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure coupling it with High Frequency Machines being used the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before When coupled with synthetic longs via options gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be and provides the ability to naked short GME again This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index The Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25 of US equity trading volume therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated Failure To Deliver A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner x200B The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past x200B ETF's being shorted in the past x200B Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted Point being The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option Operational Shorting When faced with excessive buying pressure as we have witnessed with $GME Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as Naked and then locate or create the shares at a later time up to T 6 for bona fide market making However delaying past T 3 results in a failure to deliver but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T 3 because they are making markets and have an additional three days to settle trades a total of T 6 This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay I won't go too in depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's However I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread TLDR Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that Over 3 5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card Does it solve the issue No It only delays it and makes it worse Secondly there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price Can't stop won't stop Gamestop 🙌💎 As always Lambos or Instant Noodles🚀🚗,2021-03-16 13:12:57,"1. {""GME"": ""Rise""}"

I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results.,5278,oawsxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/,1205,1625086722.0,I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right Here are the results Preamble Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489 return for his investors between Nov’00 and Jun’08 SP500 returned just 3 in the same period But I recently observed that in every news article/tweet he always talks about an impending crash As recently as last week he issued another warning stating that there would a “mother of all crashes soon due to the meme stock and currency rally that will approach the size of countries” Basically what I wanted to analyze was Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time Analysis The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News 1 I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the a Next 1 Month b Next 1 Quarter c Till Date I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous Also there are no news reports covering Burry before that The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction If Burry specifies a stock then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark If its broader prediction relating to the overall market then the benchmark used is S P 500 Results There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis came in May 2017 where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3 In his exact words I didn’t go out looking for this I just did the math Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse But it’s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine S P500 has returned a respectable 93 to date and there is no imminent threat of a World War happening Burry’s next prediction was in Sep 2019 where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago He said the flows will reverse at some point and “it will be ugly” when they do This prediction also did not pan out as S P500 has returned 50 to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid 19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery Burry’s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla’s stock price is ridiculous and that it would collapse like the housing stock bubble I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don’t know exactly when he shorted the stock The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec’20 when compared to Jan’21 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December He reiterated again on Feb’21 that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge and he is being ignored again He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble This prediction also hasn’t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11 to date over the last 4 months Burry’s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called coin a speculative bubble in March’21 coin has since dropped 28 in around 3 months Even in this case we don’t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun’21 stating that we are currently in the greatest speculative bubble of all time Only time will tell how this one will turn out Conclusion I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became extremely successful But as you can see from the above analysis he is more often wrong than right with his predictions 2 But the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately 3 Out of the 100 predictions you make even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry you will have to follow all of his recommendations 4 and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario Footnotes 1 Google News has a nifty feature where they allow you to search news in specific time periods Also Google News seems to capture almost all the major publications other than the historical archives 2 The current analysis is done using all the publicly available records We are not considering the personal bets he made conversations he had with his friends/family/investors etc This can definitely alter the 3 Take the classic example of Keith Gill aka DFV He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM This phenomenon is known as black swan farming 4 At that point if you are that confident in his predictions you can invest in his hedge fund Please note that you need to have a minimum capital requirement $1 million minimum investment and some extra regulatory requirements Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor ,2021-06-30 23:58:42,"6. {""NULL"": NULL}"

read but bare with me this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by or for the account of the seller Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale however the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three day settlement period As a result the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high This is what happened today with the price decrease Source Section II Background IMPORTANCE OF FAIL TO DELIVER The SEC

can only be higher now Regardless the sentiment stands shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward What's to be done Rule 204 Rule 204 — Close out Requirements Under Rule 204 participants of a registered clearing agency as defined in section 3 a 24 of the Exchange Act must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date referred to as T 4 if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date referred to as T 6 In addition Rule 203 b 3 of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days Threshold securities as defined by Rule 203 c 6 are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver You can read more about this here lots of information that I haven't covered Gamestop is or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail To Deliver's they've accumulated this month this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time frame stated above AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN Edit According to this website Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD TL DR The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do

under 158 11 I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid It could always form a new one I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point Edit 2 Not Financial Advice i thought that was a given Edit 3 It's back testing so far really common in Technical Analysis Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out which happens Edit 4 Backtested and bouncing so far Really important to reclaim 174 26 on the hourly close You can see we bounced off this zone from 168 07 167 55 that's key demand or support Edit 5 Reclaimed 174 26 back tested that as well Key levels are normally retraced as we move Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support Now 174 26 must hold as support and we are looking pretty good Edit 6 Bull flagging now into lunch time New support put up at 176 48 Constructive Edit 7 Great breakout from that flag New support put up at 181 50 Still need the 1 45 close for confirmation Look at the volume on that candle shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives Edit 8 Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open quit trading you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl Self proclaimed geniuses saying TA Doesn't Work On GME Ban it's not that TA doesn't work on GME The issue is all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before I don't blame you for feeling that way though so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it doesn't mean you should dismiss it The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly insane how sentiment shifted You guys are getting played like a fiddle The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat Lastly I appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn DMs are open Edit 9 189 00 is the next resistance coming up careful there Like I said 181 50 is the new support to hold Still on track for my price targets Volume is in all the right spots Edit 10 Backtested we are moving again Support is actually a zone from 182 51 181 50 Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two Remember some resistance at 189 00 might flag there the rest of the day Edit 11 3 13 P M 5/18/2021 Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume Still bullish consolidation below this key 189 00 resistance Above there straight to 200 Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near term trend Edit 12 3 46 P M 5/18/2021 They got the close just below the uptrend Not a great sign but only a 15m trend so not too damning We need to hold 182 51 181 50 They are going to try and test that now Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down Edit 12 4 01 P M 5/18/2021 Not an awful close but definitely not a great one Shorts fought hard end of day the fuckers They know if we break 189 they are done for Important thing though breakout is still intact Also broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help Tomorrow will be looking for 173 02 and 167 57 to hold and looking for 182 54 to break as well as 189 00 Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this Appreciate all the awards Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out Will probably move quicker since it’s GME Edit 13 9 35 A M 5/19/2021 Again getting dragged by the broader market Major indexes opened 2 Still holding up relatively well honestly Basically between 182 54 167 57 is CHOP It's when we break one of those that we can see the next move play out Remember I said this is a swing on these kinds of trades I just focus on the daily chart and sometimes the hourly for monitoring the health of the trends Major point is Above 167 57 and that teal line the breakout is still intact Edit 14 4 00 P M 5/19/2021 What a close Actually really interesting price action today We were able to defend all those levels Not only that but we fully backtested the pattern to the tick Breakout is fully intact still so long as we are above this teal line Just sitting in limbo waiting for volume to come in Technicals often precede news so we could see a catalyst soon 1h chart 1D chart Notice the volume was garbage today too So far a textbook backtest Levels for tomorrow 168 00 163 00 support 172 60 183 11 189 00 resistance Edit 15 5/20/2021 Just another low volume sideways day Everything important is still intact You can see we backtested and defended that support this morning We also made an attempt at clearing 172 60 but never got an hourly close Looking at the same levels tomorrow Really no surprise we went sideways the rest of the week since it's OPEX Important to ignore the chop and focus on where we are in the chart Holding tomorrow's close will be especially important since it's the weekly candle Top of the triangle will be around 161 00 tomorrow Levels tomorrow 167 53 166 63 zone 164 06 161 00 support 172 60 183 11 189 00 resistance We are also forming a wedge on the 15m chart Edit 16 5/21/2021 Broke up that wedge I mentioned yesterday We are in a rising channel right now need to keep this intact So long as it is we will keep making higher lows the yellow lines OPEX week is finally over All that happened so far is we chopped sideways above the breakout point This is bullish generally Remember I said it's likely we are waiting on a catalyst of some kind technicals often foreshadow this Next week we need to make our move They key is 182 56 above here and we should be off to the 230s Key resistance For support we are looking at that yellow line the lower one it will move up each day There is also a level at 166 56 All in all everything is still on the right track Not surprised at all this week went sideways OPEX usually tries to bleed out options holders

Here are the results.,7427,mtehdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/,1116,1618787006.0,I analyzed all 700 buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021 Here are the results Preamble Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing Surprisingly there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program his program is Mad Money for those who are not familiar Where the data is from here All the 19 201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here His stock picks are updated here daily While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation Analysis There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021 Out of this 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell For both sets I calculated the stock price change across four periods a One Day b One Week c One Month d Price Change till date I also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods Results Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months If you had invested in every single stock he recommended and then pulled out the next day the returns were a staggering 555 He was also right on 58 9 of the calls he made Benchmark being 50 since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50 The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42 but he was barely touching 50 in the percentage of right picks One month from his recommendations the stock return is an abysmal 223 and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446 return and Cramer being right a whopping 63 6 in his stock picks x200B Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months 57 5 of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of 118 9 This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42 But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was 206 Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time Limitations of the analysis The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations First Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data Also currently the data is pulled from street com which was earlier owned by Cramer They update the data everyday after the show but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line very unlikely with it being a large business Also for the return calculations I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra day highs and lows Conclusion No matter how we feel about Cramer the one day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls But the data points otherwise It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation Let me know what you think Google Sheet link containing all the recommendations and analysis here Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Cramer or the Mad Money show ,2021-04-19 02:03:26,7.

me Obligatory 🚀 WARNING BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS' TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources availability and fees for shorts Enjoy this light weekend reading 😉 Part 1 FINRA I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion Note if you want to find this raw data use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file updated at 6pm daily and search for GME then copy the raw numbers the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to this is not a user friendly document There was an additional 22 million in short volume today on top of the 33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio The short volume as of total daily volume as published by FINRA is at 57 which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27 29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price CAVEATS This data does not include NYSE which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million Thanks to u/tri fire engineer for bringing this up He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that once NYSE data was included Short Volume went up from 56 8 to 57 6 I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke t daily data does NOT equate to of total shares that are shorted as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun Here are my data tables again all taken from the FINRA daily data Assumptions used GME Float Stock 54 490 000 this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M GME Total Shares 69 750 000 The FINRA site also now lists GME short of float at 60 35 Thanks to u/wrek for sending this Part 2 Borrowing Shares Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME The data available through iborrowdesk com For those wondering about the site check out the about page the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site Note This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from 2 million at 1 1 borrow rate to only 450 000 at 9 borrow rate The last time there were less than 500 000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5 as seen through this site was on Jan 27 when we saw some huge intraday price swings Part 3 ETFs This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME For example 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175 shorted 16 1m shares on 9 2m and GME as 9 of its portfolio Doing some quick math of $73M of GME at $117 620k shares of GME x 185 short position 1 1m GME shares shorted They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved ie shorted “…we have detected an approximate $85 8 million dollar outflow that's a 12 0 decrease week over week from 9 200 000 to 8 100 000 ” If these numbers are true then it is shorted closer to 199 16 1m shorts / 8 1m shares NOTE you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF TLDR THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME BUT 💎🙌 💎 will prevail Stake shares in GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 PS you guys I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week Shoutouts to u/RicFlairsCape u/Rrrrandle u/CultureCrypto for some good suggestions on the last post which I have incorporated For those interested here is some more info from FINRA about this data The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security

volume associated with trades reported to each TRF FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret FINRA/NYSE the ADF and the ORF There is also a file entitled Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume

GME DD on April 2020 similarities to today,16297,mjf7mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjf7mg/gme_dd_on_april_2020_similarities_to_today/,1069,1617506290.0,GME DD on April 2020 similarities to today ““The tendies are coming the tendies are coming” – Paul Revere”” – HomeDepotHank69 Apes I have excellent news Today I woke up with only a half chub and thought to myself “I’m gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done ” Then my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole Here is the product of that I will warn you this is long I have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year’s annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME This is not a technical analysis this is pure DD I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice Just a note you can find all of these documents simply by searching “Gamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders” on Google I just picked out the important parts to make it easier History I am first going to start with GME’s share price as of April 2020 x200B As you can see on April 3rd 2020 GME’s price bottomed to under $2 This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the “bankruptcy jackpot ” However on April 3rd and the next few days we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6 Why was this Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020 Well that’s not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th which caused a rise on Monday the 13th x200B So if it wasn’t Michael Burry’s announcement of his position then what was it Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder’s meeting Nope that was announced in late April as well x200B So if it wasn’t either of those things then what was it The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd 2020 which seems pathetic compared to today’s price action was due to a group of activist investors Hestia Capital who owned 7 5 of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting When was this letter released April 3rd 2020 x200B Why is this significant Well for some reason it was pretty well known that GME’s short interest was over 100 at this time still blows my mind that more people didn’t pounce on this at the time myself included Again this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the “bankruptcy jackpot ” I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy they wouldn’t have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn’t exist anymore this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what’s happened today Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts boy were they wrong on that one Well their plan almost worked They got it down to under $3 Then this statement came out Why is that statement significant Well this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20 2020 x200B Look back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this BOOM This company announces that and people start recalling their shares forcing some shorts to cover GME’s massive short interest at this time was already well known x200B From that point on GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again x200B I couldn’t include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME’s massive price today This is where the shorts should’ve thrown in the towel and taken the loss but they didn’t They kept shorting GME and as we all know the short interest eventually hit 140 and the January events happened And know we’re here exactly 1 year later to the tee The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen Similarities So as stated above GME’s price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares This which was simply an urging not a full recall lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around BOOM The first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above Hestia Capital was what Ryan Cohen currently is From the proxy statement we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness x200B Also note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board ousting the C F O and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs Throughout the letter Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it This is far too much information to screenshot but I encourage you to read it for yourself Search “reasons for the solicitation” and “background of the solicitation” within the document to find these points To recap we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME GME having a massive short interest naked/abusive shorting activity the annual shareholders meeting being in June last year it was June 12th this year it is June 11th and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June Sounds pretty similar to today right But what’s the difference Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor seems to have more power in the company has a clearer vision than Hestia and is making changes more aggressively Another difference is obviously GME’s price media coverage and volume The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago almost 200x and the volume though lower recently is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago see any GME chart and compare the volume But there’s one more difference that is crucial There is an odd phenomenon in GME today A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea whose hands are strong as diamonds and whose wives have endless boyfriends Yes I am talking about apes The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price Combine that with another strange creature whose scientific name is Cetacea who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea This is our whale This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast I’m not even joking here apes have created a wall of support we have power Combine all of this with the abusive shorting failure to deliver cycle statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies The future So I broke down the past showed you the similarities and talked about the present Now what Well here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder’s meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock First I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions they are not set in stone do not base your strategy off of them and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes This is not a prediction this is simply a date/time to keep in mind I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice I am Hank Uncle Hank I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th This is a 2 week period As many of you apes know our golden ticket would be a share recall A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners Obviously this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies As I've said in my previous posts GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume As we have seen GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C F O The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings Mar 23 but this would have been a violation of SEC rules so that was off the table from the start For context here are the dates of the past four meetings June 10 June 26 Jun 10 June 2 This year’s meeting is June 12th or 11th not sure which but it’s one of those Let's use June 11 as our assumption 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12 Moreover the tenure of the current C E O also lines up with that date The current C E O is on a vesting schedule incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation Per his vesting schedule he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C E O or at the very least to announce that the current C E O is parting ways with the company Remember when this happened to the C F O in February the price returned from the dead just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C E O Now turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia’s was could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia’s which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote Or maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland the C E O knows that he’s on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he’s out OR maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs Either way if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares then maybe we will see something similar to last year That date April 15th is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16 Because of that expect at the very least higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare bones AT THE VERY LEAST we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June but I would expect something sooner At this point I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C suite executive of GME He owns 13 obviously has a huge personal interest in its success has recruited Chewey executives and maybe the person from Amazon as well and appears to be shaking up the board and other C suite positions I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it e commerce shift so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C suite executive at some point It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months C F O in February Amazon Chewey Execs in March and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day At this point it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those This is again just conjecture but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers If you've kept up with his updates he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these What he could also do is buy more calls at a later date which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock One thing is for certain he's not going to let those options expire worthless especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account Finally I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME at least the new ones and Cohen are on our side which is why a share recall would benefit them First as we all know Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said I love your shorts Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit this is when it shot up significantly in a day So as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price and why wouldn't he be he has 13 ownership there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better Now this is why a share recall would benefit GME There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME Cohen included does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25 boomer data a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates which will allow the stock to go up Assumption 2 the more likely assumption is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to warn the shorts to cover If this theory is true GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock Therefore it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure Whichever theory they subscribe to it benefits them immensely to do a recall and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely Yeah I know that was long rabbit holes will do that to ya TL DR One year ago to the tee GME’s stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares The short interest was over 100 The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME Fast forward to today exactly 1 year later and we have an activist investor changing up the company If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time GME has not provided much information on that meeting so similar to last year updates could come in the month of April We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise Not a financial advisor not financial advice Am primate ,2021-04-04

I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!,12911,n1t0yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/,1060,1619815377.0,I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S P500 returns Here are the results Preamble There is no way around it A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool I feel that it’s justified given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1 000 into 100 000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this If r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks can agree on one thing it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash Now that that’s out of the way let’s come to my hypothesis There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S P500 returns over the last 19 years I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market Basically What I wanted to know was this Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations Where is the data from The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription Stock Advisor in Canada Due to this the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US listed stocks They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance If you have seen my previous posts I always share the data used in the analysis But in this case I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription Analysis As per Motley Fool their stock picks are long term plays at least 5 years Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S P500 returns during the same period a One Quarter b One Year c Two Year d Till Date From the day of recommendation to Today Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis In this case Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price i e you could have bought the share anytime during the next day Results As we can see from the above chart Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods Their one year returns were 2X and two year returns were 3X the SPY returns Even capping for outliers stocks that gained more than 100 their returns were better than the S P benchmark But it’s not like all their strategies were good As we can see from the above chart their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13 to break even you only need to invest $770 per year Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees one has to invest around $4k every year You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e mails that they send Limitations of analysis Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013 But 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service Also I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross verification by other people But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations This peer reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S P 500 index since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short term and long term holding periods Over a longer holding period the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk adjusted measures Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006 the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011 Conclusion I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails it’s that clickbait works I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles Whatever the case may be rather than hating on something regardless of the results we could give credit where credit is due I started the research being extremely skeptical but my analysis as well as peer reviewed papers shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Motley Fools ,2021-04-30 23:42:57,

$GME Endgame - Game Theory & Best Scenarios,4690,l8t3dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/,1033,1612062701.0,$GME Endgame Game Theory Best Scenarios For those confused why BUY and HOLD are the investors best strategy both to stick it to hedge funds and profit this post is to map this out HEDGEFUND RISK First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds According to S3 analytics HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far Other reports have come out that hedge funds have lost 15 20 of assets so far this year Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here Citadel was worth $33B on Jan 1st so I believe this to be close Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal we can assume they are all in this together This prevents a prisoners dilemma for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs say an individual worth $2B Now let's assume short amount is 100 of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics This means to calculate daily interest we take 50M shares in float according to Fin Viz 25 interest rate 25/365 07 /day Share Price $300 $300 07 50M $10 2M in interest/day At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum of shares needed they can keep this up for 21 years So that's their situation The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going x200B HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others You need shares and you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere How do you do this There are three tactics likely 1 Settlement Let's go back to our shares needed 50M and value of the hedge funds $80B Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500 $1000/share So how would you do this You first use your friends to convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K Retail investors might even have an organization like SEC say they are protecting us after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is fuckers This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it Edit As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares not just government intervention x200B 2A Test Pricing Low The first test they did was to see if they could scare us A ladder attack costs them nothing And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until 2 30pm I'll explain why later I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range x200B 2B Test Pricing High Another strategy is to find a price cliff Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits This is more risky and will be used cautiously However I can't state this enough we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell x200B 3 Work with GME to Issue Shares If they think buying is dying down a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors Still keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point x200B Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks This can't go tits up Wrong Retail Investors still have the power x200B RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY So now you are a smooth brained ape What can you do to stick it to the twats x200B 1 HOLD If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares This leads to a long drawn out fight or settlement But guess what at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short term gains become long term gains less taxes x200B 2 BUY How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon RIs had two days where buying was diminished fuck Robinhood and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes maybe thanks to a whale If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP This is the most important though the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a dip Price is now pre squeeze and post squeeze If they can do this the retail investor wins The post squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell hopefully VERY HIGH and all shares purchased post squeeze will make profit x200B 3 FIND WHALES Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers x200B 4 DO IT QUICKLY HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely x200B RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING WHAT TO EXPECT Now that we understand that what will winning look like Well we have two outcomes x200B 1 Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power The price will gamma squeeze then squeeze and then game is over Watch for massive market dips x200B 2 Retail Investors Own All The Shares While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be again hopefully VERY HIGH EDIT THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100 OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL x200B TL DR Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD A successful retail investor strategy eliminates the idea that there is a dip to create a buying wall There is only pre squeeze and post squeeze prices A buying wall supported by a swath of limited order buys by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over One well intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on x200B This is not financial advise Do your own DD ,2021-01-31

to buy GameStop All of it don't upvote this it's mostly to reference later To start I would like to be very clear I am in no way investing in the short squeeze and for what I am doing it does not matter whether or not it already squoze vs yOu aRe HeRE VolksWagon graph My goal is not to make money My goal is not to lose money I am not trying to send a message I do not care about your upvotes I will not be donating any proceeds to charity Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds My goal is to own GameStop As absolutely much of it as I possibly can while I am alive and on this planet Because of this I want GME shares price to go down Whether this occurs due to algo driven price suppression or organic selling off of shares The more the value drops the more shares I can afford to buy obligatory Not financial advice I like the stock I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this Here are the facts 1 Mark Cuban raised a very valid point If you are investing in a company the way we used to as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company then prices going down is a good thing Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion 2 GameStop is poised to d o m i n a t e the space within the gaming industry Looking to build Esports arenas Guess what gyms are going out of business left and right Cheap real estate Dedicated gaming streaming channel Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming would be no surprise I'm not talking about livestreams I'm talking about produced content Speaking of live Twitch Discord Already set up and instead of competing GameStop could literally just buy these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord or leave them as is just own the revenue streams There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub epicenter really for such a massively exploding industry an industry with zero sign of slowing down Ever Entertainment as an all things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly Interactive entertainment is just unrivaled 3 The man the legend the boyfriend to all of our wives DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr G just doubled his shares position He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up I didn't do the math and I'm not gonna but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100 of those profits into shares anywhere near the top Because of this he has negative downside risk GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead I'm in a much much smaller but similar boat I made $100K and kept 100 shares which I fully intend to take to my grave This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place 4 GameStop will never be forgotten This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes the world will always always remember G M E 5 I am just fine financially My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue This is not a YOLO play I can afford to lose the money I am putting in Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance See above where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist so there's no money anyway The Plan Buy as many shares as I can afford never expecting to see that money ever again Sell a few covered calls way in the future at or out of the money As they approach expiration roll them forward another year This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops or secure and yes limit upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value As long as these options do not get exercised I will still own the shares I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25 35 cash ROI every year see below somewhere As I earn more money externally buy more shares Again as many as I can afford Every Single Year Just constantly expand my position No matter what Forever Profit never Not ever sell a single share Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to you guessed it buy more shares Remember my goal here is to own shares not to make money Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares Currently at the money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 about a year out are effectively worth 35 40 of the value of the stock Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35 each year Yes there will be a decrease in IV in this case but using externally earned money I should be able to make up the difference First milestone overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume I will never beat his gains and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns but that is fine My goal is purely share count Second milestone overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ryan cohen gamestop shares and I'm not gonna Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life before I get old and die Third milestone Own run and manage GameStop Whatever that means Member of the board sure Bust in on meetings like Hey I own most of this place someone grab me a coffee and then yell about how I pay your salary as I'm being escorted out by security more likely But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt With this strategy cumulatively expanding my position by 35 YoY I should be able to turn a 1 000 share portfolio into a 8million share portfolio in 30 years This is just based on current prices options values and my current income It couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1 $0 50 or $0 25 per share At a certain point cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock I like this stock and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success The only disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan it's not even a strategy at this point would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised calling all my shares away from me increasing my net worth by 35 all at once Or if GME just does really well organically which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all but I'm trying to do something specific here SEC interns I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone I just like the damn stock Hedgies and MMs please crank up your algos to maximum Never stop doing what you're doing I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY Current 💎🙌 shareholders you are the only thing standing in my way and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme ass prices If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits I will thank you for it If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it maybe shoot for buying back in lower I'd appreciate that even more Yes I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually whatever Might be a little bit to get started as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better But hey I have 30 years to get this sorted out right Make fun of me as I lose money Ask me for advice as I make money Call me an idiot for the platforms I use Try to sell me access to your crappy web based indicator research tools None of it will matter Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable I suppose tl dr there is no tl dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates edit 1 current positions which will change as I enact my genius plan yes I will post the first official update soon edit 2 To clarify a few things for those who apparently can't sense where some choice satire/irony/sarcasm is within this post as well as those who straight up can't do math Anyone who didn't chuckle at least a little bit at Gwitch and Gamescord is for sure dead inside Yeah Twitch may be out of reach but check out the timelines of Twitter adding pics Instagram adding videos and Vine existing yes vine is dead but TikTok took over that vibe I guarantee you something will be the Next Twitter or the Next Instagram or the Next Tiktok It likely will not literally replace these things but it will provide the next thing users want that hasn't been addressed And it will grow too big to get back the audience these 3 giants will have lost Something similar could happen with gaming And if GameStop makes it or buys the small service outright before they get too big to be bought then the prophecy will have come true Sick burns everyone I have not laughed this hard reading comments here since I first discovered WSB I absolutely love you guys The adderall bits in particular are gold Yes I am at baseline as of writing this stuff my baseline is high as a my risk tolerance Apologies for the length and lack of formatting and emojis This was really just supposed to be for me to point at later when people are all Why exactly are you doing this on future posts As Blaise Pascal said I would have written a shorter letter but I did not have the time edit 3 Okay basic math time Yes I calculated this with what few crayons I had not eaten so y'all can relax and let me do the reeeeing for you If you have $100 and you make 10 return you then will have $110 If with that new amount $110 you following and you make another 10 return now you have $121 Now I know it seems like you should have $120 and some of you seem to think that in order to turn $100 into $121 that I would have to add $21 of my own money from somewhere else But this is the magic of how ROI woks and a little thing called cumulative returns Okay gonna keep this in dollars for a moment just so you guys can follow and I don't lose anyone though it seems many of you stopped reading at Gwitch anyway and those are probably the only people here who could follow this elaborate and complex algorithm Let's say you own $1 000 and you can make 35 returns each year for 30 years This would be calculated as $1 000 x 1 35 30 Type that into a calculator and you'll get over $8Million Trust me and trust your calculator This isn't magic It's investing Now if you own 1000 share of a company and you call sell call options on those shares for 35 of the value of said shares then it does not matter what the share price is as the price goes up so does the value of that call option as the price goes down surely you get it by now If you quickly reinvest that money into the same shares at the same price then you will have increased your holdings by 35 On a yearly basis assuming the stock value ends at or below your strike price by expiration and assuming the IV remains high enough to do it again the following year then you could just do it again once that all expires worthless Only now you can do it with 1300 shares 1400 if you go ahead and just buy 50 more At this rate you would theoretically end up with 8 million shares at the end of 30 years If you can secure 5 more shares cumulatively on a weekly basis without them ever getting called away from you would own over 323 million shares within 5 years tl dr for real real this time If the stock literally ends every week lower than the previous week and ends every year lower than the previous year forever and assuming the volatility remains high or that I can make up the difference via infusions of cash externally Then I'm gonna own all of GameStop somewhere between 5 and 30 years from now If the stock goes up consistently especially if it goes up significantly then it will be very difficult to accomplish this Because math Wow my first ever gold Thank you kind stranger See y'all from the board room ,2021-02-21 08:43:30,"6. {""GME"": ""Drop""}"

analysis part II Disclosure This is not investment advice I own shares of GME I like the stock This is purely my opinion and these numbers have not been audited Round 2 Ding ding ding Here's my previous analysis TL DR The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way Analysis Currently Roughly $227m in value or 11 6m shares call put are in the money At each $10 threshold up to $150/share approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment At $160/share approximately 2m shares come into the money nbsp Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price meaning gamma is also largest It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed creating a sequence of gamma squeezes nbsp If price were to squeeze up to $810/share 56b market cap The net calls in the money would exceed the float This is insane Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying it's not possible to cover more than 100 of float 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze This in turn would create a massive short squeeze even if current short reporting is accurate which is somewhat questionable at this point there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price but also because of share lenders calling shares P S Not sure how this works so would like to hear others weigh in if they understand this better Really hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions nbsp As of 3/3 close Call Value ITM Put Value ITM $226m Call Shares ITM Put Shares ITM 11 5m Data nbsp Here's the call put at various different prices nbsp close price call put

Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,7813,l8efqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8efqp/why_buying_amc_helps_save_a_beloved_american/,1013,1612012012.0,Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds As we all know AMC is the second most shorted stock in existence behind only GME of course However the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores which GME did in large numbers this past year In place of the underperforming stores GME is expanding furiously into e commerce With RC now at the helm strategically its future is bright AMC is in the exact opposite situation It operates theaters which it cannot close down without permanent serious consequences There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic There is no e commerce pivot It has theaters and that's it For a while now AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times The shorts almost won This is where we come in The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds It is a lifeline to the real world operations of AMC A few days back one of AMC's debt holders converted $600 million worth of debt into stock and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions It an SEC filing this morning AMC said it will be issuing around 44 4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction which will reduce its debt by $600 million Earlier this month AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity in this case 14 million shares plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan As part of its recently announced fundraising AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4 80 a share It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year Now a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts But that didn't happen The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone The shorts will not win anymore it's just a matter of how much they lose This movement is legitimately saving a real American company This is not patriotic jingoism AMC by the nature of its business employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate The vast majority of its screens are in the US with a solid representation in Europe as well Yeah the popcorn is overpriced but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy And the enemy Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time This is not financial advice I just love the stock and hate hedge funds ,2021-01-30 15:06:52,"{""AMC"": ""Rise""}"

your enemies and know yourself you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself you will win one and lose one if you do not know your enemies nor yourself you will be imperiled in every single battle x200B This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME Surprise it's all the same people guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story Thing is even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S P Small Cap ETF some of these guys have very big positions against Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations What you have got remember is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful If you can't be bothered to look at the information below the big bosses are Melvin Citadel and Susquehanna SIG I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna SIG might be the final boss Guess what Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel Edit Guess who also owns 4 225 900 of puts totalling $85 448 000 and 4 196 299 of calls totalling $84 849 000 in RKT you are right Susquehanna Big thanks to the u/ Dadri88 below for this Guess who else also has a big position in RKT yep just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel $59 770 000 in calls and $37 189 000 in puts If I had a really big hedge fund maybe I would put puts and calls on a company push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna x200B Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool The company employs Bill Chen a World Series of Poker star in its quantitative trading group x200B The idiots on TV might say we are turning the market into a casino however we as shareholders are up against a company that has bluffing as a core part of its trading strategy and company culture Anyway here is the list MELVIN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP Total GME Position PUTS 6 000 000 Position Value PUTS $113

"How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding Shares",18607,ledjwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/,1002,1612694795.0,How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th 22nd or 25th with GME's 69 75 Million Outstanding Shares EDIT This post is meant as a mathematical Middle School Algebra exercise regarding GME stock and shorts The title itself is meant to be the literal end as intended and describes how it would be impossible for all shorts estimated to be covered closed and completely done and finished with only using the available outstanding shares on the specific days stated Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA I have hopefully labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations and pointed out some general assumptions more shorts mean more gains sarcastically that do not always appear to be true in the given data These are just general findings so chill the fuck out x200B Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA Jan29th text file Feb 5th text file regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices I promise you the long read is worth it but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9 The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached Please help out if there are any huge oversights or wrong calculations in the comments below as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver or just shady as fuck Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME source Yahoo Finance Figure 1 No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know So as EVERYONE KNOWS shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased and with supply and demand we aim for the heavens Figure 2 Shorts and Short Exempts note y axis is in MILLIONS as reported by FINRA during regular business hours So let's do a quick sanity check Looking at Figure 2 we see that on Jan 13th over 40 MILLION shorts were executed So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th we should expect to see that the price increased which it did Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day Figure 3 Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day Figure 4 GME Price change relative to the opening price that day Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day Again we see that Jan 13th increased by over 50 that day So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed and the price change for the same day Figure 5 GME Price change relative to opening price and the total number of shorts both short and short exempts during Regular Business Hours via FINRA NOW WE GOT A PLOT Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day But what do we actually get from Figure 5 Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS but we don't see that across the board though Jan 13th Jan 22nd Jan 26th and Feb 5th all show gains in price and large number of shorts 22 days I tracked and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours but only 4 days have gains of 20 or greater and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50 Eye Raise Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet The screaming cries of wallstreetbets Hmmmmm ok well maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts The HYPE was/IS real over GME and the world took notice Let's see how the volume changed with it First just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours x200B Figure 6a Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME as reported by FINRA Alright what do we get out of this plot Well from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF compared to early January BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend General Assumption I'M MAKING Most of the actual Retail Investors didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd x200B Figure 6b Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b So ASSUMING the above let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney So what's with the crazy high volume before then Is it from the insiders the true chosen among us the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots NOPE Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on The big bois had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000 short shares maybe Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading After Hours Volume Figure 7 Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME I DO LOVE PLOTS Here I've taken the regular hours volume again from FINRA and subtracted it from the day's total volume as reported by Yahoo Finance to get the After Hours Volume But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd and has remained where MOST of the action is going on GENERALLY Retail Investors don't/CANT engage in after hours trading And also don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker dealers and big bois are doing at 2am We see around Jan 13th after hour volume went above 50million my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts and the few following days thereafter Hmmmm OK let's take a step back and look shorts again x200B Figure 8 Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume just during regular hours are shorts I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts if so PLEASE COMMENT IT And because I can't get after hours short volume we have to make a wild guess as to this next step So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get Figure 9 Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance NOTE Figure 9 is an estimate but it's still a low ball estimate ASSUMPTION Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75 of just shorts Still let's roll with Figure 9 Looking at Jan 13th we estimate the number of shorts executed was over 76 MILLION And there are 69 75M shares outstanding yep ok checks out x200B TLDR Go to Figure 9 NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE and a low one at that and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts ON THOSE DAYS see edit below x200B Not financial advice not advocating violence not legal advice just doing some math while my wife and her boyfriend watch The Crown Edit 1 Yes title is a typo Shorts WE ARE Covered smh Edit 2 finra link seems to break for some with the https // in the front try it without and added direct links to text files Also no I did not include ways to cover shorts with options/bought/sold/traded/fails to deliver/NoExpirationShortsJustPayInterest/t 3/etc since I already threw a god awful amount of text at you and literally pointed to exact dates and

How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire,5713,m3i8kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3i8kc/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of_millionaire/,999,1615586796.0,How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire So you did it You did your due diligence you did the math you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having Millionaire Congratulations You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome You played the game and came out on top Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of or that car you always wanted to drive right Sure if you want to lose your title of millionaire However if you 'd like to stay a millionaire there are some things you may like to consider This is not financial advice but rather 3 pieces of life suggestions A survival guide so to speak of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title x200B First protect it from everyone else DON'T TELL ANYBODY If there is one thing you take away from this let it be this So let me repeat that DON'T TELL ANYONE This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends and your family but doing this WILL ruin your life Why Well everyone is gonna want a cut They're gonna say they need that new device or they need that new car or they need this or that They'll bring up how far you go back Suddenly you'll see the very people who have been your friends turn on you like vultures They may think they have your best interests in mind and they may not the harm they're causing but they'll smell money and they're gonna come asking In that case you've gotta be the bad guy You've gotta be the one to say no And friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them Or you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits To put it differently this isn't a question of who do you tell because word spreads Rather this is a question of social survival Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family Yes Then keep it to yourself Money talks but wealth whispers x200B Second protect it from expenses If you want this money to last more than 5 years you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there Wait what Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it You will use it Just not as a sum of cash If you have $1 8 million you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200 000 Lamborghini You'll only have $600 000 left Instead you might want to turn to FIRE or Financial Independence Retire Early There you are going to use your newfound money as a source of income An easy equation for this is 4 That's it That's the equation 4 of your net worth can be used yearly while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7 interest annually This way you beat inflation and you cover your expenses So to use our $1 8 million under the 4 rule that's $72 000 you can spend annually and in theory you will never run out of funds while never working another day in your life Or if you enjoy what you're doing you can add that to the equation as well How you break it up is up to you but you can very easily spend north of $100 000 a year and still be in the green if you hold down a job Meanwhile let's check in on our $600 000 That's $24 000 a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today That's uncomfortably close to poverty You don't deserve that x200B Third protect it from yourself Yes Yourself As quickly as you made your money you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life So right now emotions are probably high You're beyond excited you are itching to do something crazy with your money and probably want to buy something since you can't tell anyone per part 1 Don't buy anything right now Yes you read that right Don't buy anything If you need any proof on that look up what happens to lottery winners roughly 35 of which go bankrupt Rather set the money aside for a while You can determine this amount of time but a good rule of thumb is 6 months In those 6 months it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself collect your thoughts and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money How you want to invest it how much you want to use per year and how much you owe in taxes Yes The dreaded 't word' Taxes You've gotta pay up And during that planning process you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life x200B So there you have it A starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire written by someone who has never been a millionaire But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future x200B To close they say money can't buy you happiness but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life If you want to live generously leaving anonymous gifts and donations giving all you have away you can do that If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up over spending at every turn you can also do that But you will need to face the consequences of either decision And if you in your nature default to one of these paths but don't want to it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all x200B Oh who am I kidding This is WallStreetBets You will all be fine Just be careful my friends As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life x200B Edit While I mentioned it in point 3 it should absolutely be a point of it's own So by popular demand x200B Fourth protect it from the government Roughly 40 of earnings is going to go to the federal government if you're earning over 1 000 000 That's not even accounting for any state income taxes which vary wildly from state to state And before we continue I will allow a moment for a collective ouch from everyone reading That's a lot I won't deny that But as much as it sucks you've gotta pay up Because if you don't the IRS can very very easily take ALL of it 100 And they will leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees and no money to pay them So please please please make sure you pay the taxes my friends ,2021-03-13 00:06:36,"7. {""NULL""}"

you don't know that gets you into trouble It's what you know for sure that just ain't so Mark Twain “When the rich rob the poor it’s called business When the poor fight back it’s called violence ” – The Apocryphal Twain I The Short Interest Numbers Short interest SI is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares See Apparently other firms have used different versions of float All other forms of float are likely incorrect and not likely used by Finra This is an important assumption if I am wrong here then fuck Edit to above People are suggesting my float is wrong That is exactly my point I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA post it this post is then useless The math working backwards from 226 is fair game however That's why it's possible I'm wrong see See also comment by JeanGuyRubberboots below ctrl f Either way it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock I want to see the actual float used by FINRA Until then here's the math based on the SI equation Total outstanding shares of GME is 69 75 million See Finra SI of GME is 78 as of January 27th See 78 69 75 million 54 405m Thus 54 045m million shares are short GME of January 27th To calculate real SI we remove insider ownership Another big assumption Insider ownership stands at 19 06m See Thus free float is outstanding shares less insider ownership shares 50 750 000 shares Real SI appears at minimum 1 07 54 405m/50 750m II The Shorts Remaining and Covered On January 15th GME SI stood at 121 See Thus from January 15th to the 27th we know at least 84 397m shares were shorted 1 21 outstanding shares By January 27th 54 405m shorts remained previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1 27 The number of shorts that covered from Jan 15th to the 27th was was 29 992m 29 992m/84 397m shares 35 Thus 65 of shorts pre squeeze remain owing APR Around 35 of covering resulted in a 1 600 rise Thus a 65 cover rate conservative can yield a 2 971 rise Let’s apply this math to now From $50 this is a $1 485 50 GME price result Could this happen No idea Notice the problem with this I'm assuming only covering led to this rise So this is simply a demonstrative point New shorts from Jan 27th to present likely opened at higher prices 65 of those from $5 $10 $20 etc probably remain This is bad news for HF's III The Effect Based on estimated remaining covers price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM This part is unclear We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze In my opinion it wasn't until drops below $200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts This is a substantial point if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought then the pain points for HF's are far lower It's just unclear Nonetheless HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions See You'd think these are correlated markets so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted Or because there is no volume on the stock I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions but I imagine they're higher I don't know more beyond this Feel free to debate Moreover consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME It appears that retail buying power is spent People either cashed out or are holding So they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze or a gamma one for that matter Thus the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional Not all hedge funds are short $GME nor are all financial whales In my view this has become an institutional fight with both sides pointing the gun at each other waiting who's going to pull the trigger first Retail is simply on the sidelines holding the clips in for both their guns smirking of course How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart they can't be fooled twice etc and all of that non sense But before intelligence comes greed And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system IV Parting Thoughts It would take a half brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers Yet Finra was late posted after hours I think This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers yet again dead silence from the mainstream media Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests Americans with $2 000 in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud that is the general public and the focus doesn’t appear to be on hedge funds and not the Big Money that loop hole engineered an illegal 140 naked short situation See see also The Big Short is illustrative It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions Put differently fraud doesn't just pervade the system nay it is the system Everything I've seen just doesn't feel right Understand at this point I'm speculating But I trust my gut There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME This is beyond my knowledge span However if you looked at the bid ask spreads this week of $GME they were at times pennies apart for days I've never seen that before Seriously what the fuck DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood Citadel and Melvin Capital Next Thursday is a day to watch for me Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America and arguably the globe Americans and the world will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50 90 For many their life savings No it wasn't a result of imprudent investments to invest money into a squeezing stock is a good idea short term It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money So when the risk of you getting that rich increased they stopped the game pun intended We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion that's just speculation and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is But think of how this plays out these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it Or they tell you the truth that based on risk management and capital models they never thought retail would get that rich that fast Either way I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television A key element to the public's reaction AOC grilling the hell out of these folks That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching And to set the record straight I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands middle America is holding because they have nothing to lose after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired In the process of stunting buying pressure they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders Poetic justice and fucking hilarious I'm not demonizing rich people We all want financial freedom I'm demonizing cheating the game However this ends one thing is clear The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie TLDR it's in the damn title Disclaimer because working people are vilified when the financial system is exposed does this sound familiar It should because it's a reoccurring pattern When rich people lose poor people are blamed and we foot the bill I'm a random guy on the internet stating my opinions so if you take my advice to do anything without your own research you are dumb This DD could be garbage If you disagree comment below and counter me I don't want an echo chamber Not a GME promotion just more DD

of the DD where you’ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex Palantir designer u /gottacroe and my wife u /LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein Lots of words below so here’s the TL DRs Table of Contents a self dox and position disclosure before my DD TL DR 1 After watching Demo Day twice I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG MSFT and CRM Apollo is absolutely incredible and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines Lastly it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best of class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir Bottom line I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day You've come a long way baby TL DR 2 IBM just surrendered to PLTR In the words of POTUS this is a… Big Fucking Deal To put it politely IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp First they ignore you Then they laugh at you Then they fight you Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades TL DR 3 Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal Rio Tinto and PG E signing a new enterprise deals AT T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills and 2 500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world etc IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world If they’re in I’m in TL DR 4 Eventually institutional traders will comprehend the immense long term value of Planeteer Planter Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club Table of Contents 1 Praise Constructive Criticism for Demo Day 2 Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit 3 The True ROI of Palantir 4 Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines 5 Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments 6 Should you YOLO on PLTR 7 My Appreciation for the Palantir Team 8 Musings on Earnings and Unlocking Because there are so many shills pumpers and bullshiters on WSB these days I’ll self dox myself I’m Jason Payne I joined Palantir in early 2007 when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams and left in 2015 to become the CEO of Ada Diamonds hence my username I joined Reddit to do an official AMA on laboratory grown diamonds a few years ago that hit the front page stuck around and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community Thus I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD I’m not Turns out I have a DD writing fetish Don’t kink shame Here’s a couple of my prior DDs on De Beers Tiffany Co and the FTC Positions or ban At the current PLTR share price I hold a Keyser Söze position I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset But I’m not going to I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20 and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon to be unlocked 80 with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position regardless of earnings tomorrow Why I like the stock a lot 1 Praise Constructive Criticism for Demo Day Existentially Demo Day was incredibly impressive This thread with u/namingisreallyhard u/DentalFox and u/jamauer sums it up x200B Four things stood out to me Superior Design Language to CRM MSFT and GOOG Palantir has a completely different front end user experience UX than my time at Palantir that I saw for the first time on Demo Day I find it practical beautiful and efficient The design language is called Blueprint Javascript and it’s built on React a modern web development platform that Facebook built Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS meaning that anyone can use it Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data dense interfaces for desktop applications Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning the flat UX of Google and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded Getting that balance right is really difficult Deep Investment in Deployability Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software No one buys the backend system so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1 0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools Gmail Calendar AdWords etc The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40 75 faster than Salesforce Migration from ‘ Find the Terrorist ’ to ' Cheat Code for War ' When I was at Palantir the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war ’ and I think that is spot on That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics mission planning command and control etc military contracts recently including the Space Force DoD IL 6 SaaS Approval Palantir moving to IL 6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own but I’ll keep it short It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day I’d give the presenters a C at best I found it rushed confusing and difficult to follow I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content and I’ve given 500 Palantir demos in my lifetime My constructive criticism Slow down 15 20 Err on the side of a simpler more approachable lexicon For the love of God stop reading from scripts Use bullet points Handoffs were way to abrupt Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation · I don't know if it is just me but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way · It lacked charisma and charm and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students · I was watching the demo day presentation and left feeling underwhelmed It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry but from someone outside of it it all sounded greek to me · I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day if everyone told you that you ‘ killed it ’ you really need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power 2 Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me At Palantir we build Iron Man suits not robots No Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits AFAIK Palantir builds cerebral cyborgs not physical cyborgs Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve cerebral tasks not physical tasks x200B Iron Man Cerebral Edition If you have not watched Demo Day yet or you rewatch it listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers ’ Why a diamond fisted Iron Man suit Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents 3 The True ROI of Palantir Palantir is really expensive No question about it But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir Bad Decisions Being wrong is really really expensive See the Airbus 380 Microsoft’s market share of cell phones the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant shorting GME in early January and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization For example Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33 There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350 and the Foundry powered decisions led to a 33 improvement in production Palantir doesn’t make that claim Airbus makes that claim That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise x200B The BP renewal and the new deals PG E Rio Tinto Fiat etc prove u/petroduct is right If you have complex logistics you should have Foundry Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6 9 How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4 20 how much will their bottom line grow by 2025 Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations however if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved even a little bit the value to United is fucking deep The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry minor edits for brevity The return to service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity internal external to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover the models need to account for slow recoveries fast recoveries and everything in between Our optimization models consider when “big events” airframe checks engine overhauls and landing gear overhauls will be due along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them The models also incorporate other factors parts availability and cost available technician hours at each maintenance station ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers aircraft specific mechanical reliability and on time performance and even the quality of the in flight products seats Wi Fi entertainment power outlets The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program minimizes operating costs and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft the lowest cost aircraft or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event x200B 4 Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines Toward the end of the Apollo demo one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines IL 6 Clouds In Nuclear Submarines As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server x200B 5 Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture Booz BAE etc The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale In my mind the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument When I was at Palantir it was a bitch to build and manage deployments From what I saw on Demo Day Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce Lightning Apex SOQL and Visualforce Eventually Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP Salesforce Microsoft etc but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere Eventually Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments But in the meantime Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers FDEs will continue to directly manage deployments Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs I no longer worry about the scalability of that team Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG E ConEd and Entergy Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG E 1 year in ConEd and none in Entergy PG E improves decision making by 10 and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization ConEd improves decision making by 2 and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result They do not renew Assuming $500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal To put it another way when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years the FDE overhead is spooky But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long operating system for XXXXXX deals the FDE overhead is not significant Also to be honest there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is much less how to write code against it so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time 6 Should you YOLO on PLTR I’m not going to give anyone financial advice but I do want to point out a few things PLTR is not a meme stock Palantir is not a small cap that can move bigly because a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest most important organizations in the world Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued They may be right A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR CathThey may be right So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up down or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes Regardless of the ticker if you YOLO please YOLO responsibly my friends and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like a lot 7 My Appreciation for the Palantir Team I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades what you have built is incredible Thank you As an American thank you As a stockholder thank you Enjoy your tendies you’ve earned them my friends 8 How I Play My Lockup Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position regardless of a good bad or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG like is growth coming over the next 10 years Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years Also with the shares finally unlocked I can borrow against them for the first time I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre IPO so I’m not in any rush to sell My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of $100B with a ladder up to $250B So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5 of my remaining shares this week That’s my $0 02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news So long and thanks for all the tendies See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang 💎🙌💎 🚀🚀🚀,2021-02-16 07:19:22,"{""PLTR"": ""Rise"", ""IBM"":

Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon: Technical Analysis of Lordstown Motors,1449,mma558,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mma558/hitch_a_ride_to_the_moon_technical_analysis_of/,959,1617853234.0,Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon Technical Analysis of Lordstown Motors PART 1 Introduction Disclaimer This is not financial advice I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY why would you blindly listen to me Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors $RIDE It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out and I’m all for it I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling” coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real to be a credible source But enough metaphors Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance an electric full size pickup truck If any of you are like me you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon ” you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock So that’s what I intend to do I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of If you want some of that check out the post that was just made on the subject Instead using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings I will prove that not just I but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on oversold stocks like $RIDE that have all of the FUD priced in live and die by the motto “buy the fear sell the greed” I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way If you find yourself falling asleep at any point just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book PART 2 Technical Analysis Now as I already laid out I believe that $RIDE is undervalued however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone I prefer to trade on indicators Many people have told me I read tea leaves they call me John D Cuckefeller and if you feel the same then read no further But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with Volume and Short Interest Before we get into the technical analysis I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic short sales According to the numbers given to us by Fintel short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report and has largely fallen and consolidated since then Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally Not only are they scared of people like you who will target a stock just to hurt short sellers but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house Even given all this $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month to a total of 12 5 percent the total float And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent reveal of the endurance betas the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3 4 years away from production” like the bears claimed This is in my opinion very significant as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet Relative Strength For anyone who’s a fan of indicators it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up Just look at any relative strength oscillator many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics I won’t get too mathematical on you but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock Pretty simple $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company x200B The relative strength of $RIDE shown by Stochastics More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion MACD This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form Don’t overcomplicate this when the purple line is above the orange line the stock often goes up and when it’s below the orange line it goes down Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events In times of high volatility violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here GameStop x200B MACD analysis on GME Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time I noticed this crossover beginning to form and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing and the rest should be obvious A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150 the very next day I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more and in a time of great FUD I bought more Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu Or did is it just me Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real world example with GME just take a look for yourself with $RIDE x200B MACD analysis on $RIDE looking absolutely bullish AF A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀 This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago Historically the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center Similarly we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner I wonder what it was Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying When you see a MACD like this I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting Price Action PRICE ACTION The most important indicator of all It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around For the sake of simplicity I won’t go too far into this one Individual candlesticks are valuable but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment and more importantly the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so Specifically a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out but instead just look at the actions of real market participants Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things Positive divergence of the MACD and price action Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend and price is now consolidating before liftoff Instead of the smooth 1 day period chart we’re looking at a 4 hour period for more details Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up This is called positive divergence and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction which is a pretty big deal Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us As of just yesterday April 6th the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash a huge amount of upward pressure is building The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator this could result in a “ Bollinger Band Squeeze upwards very soon These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at and for $RIDE specifically the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30 $35 and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this PART 3 Catalysts and Fundamentals Since indicators are driven by price action which is itself driven by catalysts they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to As far as catalysts go Lordstown did just release their beta trucks last week News which I cannot stress enough I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET as discussed earlier They are also showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off road race in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 less than 10 days away Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse off competitors The current price just doesn’t make sense I also I like the design of the truck itself image is everything especially when compared to some of its competitors I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing Not to mention the Cybertruck Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially Yesterday the Camping World CEO tweeted a leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel through their partnership The electric RV market could be huge The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid for now PART 4 Conclusion Well I hope you learned a few things from this post even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here As I stated this is not my full time job I do this as a hobby Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired And for $RIDE specifically the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this Lest we all forget Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla have a good $RIDE everyone and don’t let the short bugs bite Positions 65 shares at 12 94 2x $20 07/16C 1x 15$ 01/21/22c EDIT Forgot to add but per page 21 of this slide deck the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6 2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2 01 billion An EV stock that is trading almost 50 below its asset value Come on now Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy TLDR I love $RIDE’s pretty charts and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore IMO $RIDE is poised for a breakout and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀,2021-04-08 06:40:34,"1. {""RIDE"": ""Rise""}"

DD: Gamestop Price Analysis -- still a Deep Fucking Value under $550,12303,mhcmi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcmi4/dd_gamestop_price_analysis_still_a_deep_fucking/,957,1617244709.0,DD Gamestop Price Analysis still a Deep Fucking Value under $550 TLDR Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus analysts haven’t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward On its current trajectory $550 750 a share is a reasonable my worthless opinion price point with or without the squeeze Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze but also a deep fucking value bet Fair warning you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts with colors to make visualization easy Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition Edit also see latest update 4/1 Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs Max Pain Explained Chapter 1 Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff Operating Loss An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now peaking in 2018 as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced theft of sales to the e commerce giants the convenience of online downloads and pre ordering on the internet In the last two years this loss has come down significantly And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand currently $635M Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash Most are in debt and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times x200B And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under Toys R Us and Sears as example feeding frenzy blood in the water you get the point Sharks HFs have been getting more and more bold reckless in their targeting Gamestop was the wrong target for a very specific reason It leases its stores By comparison consider Walmart needing to reduce stores or Target They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs huge upfront costs sunk and they rent or own these buildings under much different contracts They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores Ask yourself how would Walmart leave a store Who would buy it How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center On the cheap WalMarts costs are priced into this it’s expensive They can’t move as easily Point being Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently This is why we see this fast turn around in Operating Loss last year a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news Remember that The media will try to sell it as such Because of the focus Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales for its future Chapter 2 Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone at this point that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34 of all Gamestop sales Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019 x200B So what caused this Ryan fucking Cohen And he’s just getting started When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent We have only to look at Chewy’s online sales figures under Cohen to project what’s to come for Gamestop in the next few years x200B That’s right Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3 500M 17x in 3 years under Cohen Gamestop Announced in it’s Q4 earnings report last week what it’s intentions are “Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E Commerce and customer experience increasing our speed of delivery providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue ” Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics Media space in ecommerce let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector x200B Chapter 3 Electronics Media Sales If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it’s money Look no further than the category of Electronics Media Gaming computers electronics digital media In 2020 the company did 120 9 Billion in sales and 54 6 of that fell into this category There are plenty of other players in this space but only Apple is close to Amazon’s market share Here is a chart to visualize the largest players Gamestop is 10 currently with their 2020 sales the tiny orange slice x200B Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34 2 in the next two years Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it’s website earlier this week and they sold out instantly With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020 and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon’s growth models for the next two years Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon and Chewy relationships to pull talent to go after this space If chewy is any indication I wouldn’t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage even the majority of it So let’s get to the fun part… valuation x200B Chapter 4 What is Gamestop Worth Valuations are a funny thing Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future Often we start with fundamentals but in the end hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations I’ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point Gamestop $12B Market Cap and Roblox $36B Market Cap … we’re all gamers here right We know what Roblox is right Two completely different companies but let’s look at the figures anyway and then I’ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 up from $435Million in 2019 and it’s valuation rose from $4B to $36B Hmmm… why Well it went public IPO is a great way to hype a stock Get people excited maximize valuation so those angel investors can finally get paid off So how does this compare to Gamestop minus the hype of an IPO Well Gamestop did $6 466Million in revenue in 2020 Yep seven times what Roblox did So why the major difference in Market Cap Well for one Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop’s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant it should be If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox right now… it would move it’s price to approximately $5 157 a share That’s not a squeeze number That’s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth Gamestop is moving that direction minus the IPO but they are aiming to grow like Chewy did x200B So let’s get a better comparison to the other giants Apple Amazon Chewy Target Walmart and Best Buy I’ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue Value players like Buffet are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio similar to P/E ratio to levels that are very high One thing you’ll notice in this chart The more online a company is the higher it’s P/S ratio can go This directly impacts the Valuation of the company While companies that may be online but still rely most heavily on their stores have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs You’ll notice Gamestop in the middle because it’s transitioning to ecommerce Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it’s online business it’s P/S is likely to rise and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop while not changing anything about it fundamentals x200B Final Chapter Conclusions Ok you’ve been patient and I told you I’d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently and next year projection What the market hasn’t caught onto yet that we all see in Gamestop is it’s deep fucking value So what is Gamestop worth right now Well $191 that’s what it’s trading at It’s only worth more when people see these numbers and get excited about them The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth I don’t know what Q1 numbers are but I can guess a lot of Apes are really excited about Gamestop and becoming more and more loyal to its brand I know I wouldn’t buy anything from Amazon that I could get from Gamestop right now even if it costs slightly more It’s because of quality and support for the brand Lots of things are increasing Gamestop’s valuation but growth of it’s online sales will be the most significant one What most analysts are ignoring or simply missing if I’m giving them some credit is just how massive Gamestop’s online sales growth were last year despite the pandemic If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021 and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board one can expect 3 4 times as much in online sales next year That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is… an Amazon killer going after an $88B market in Electronics Media by 2023 On top of that growing an esports brand I suspect that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023 Project these figures onto Gamestop as you’d like I’ll take a stab at it Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share based on it’s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it’s finish in 2020 Q4 By this time in 2023 we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12 5B in sales and a P/S in the 4 0 ballpark that puts it’s per share price at $795 conservatively without hyper on the growth that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2 3 How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12 5B in two years… Ryan fucking Cohen is how Multiple current sales by 17 Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you’re wondering how that’s possible There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market growing Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another… I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze no dates no times and a look at how high we might go spoiler there is no accurate answer but there is a lot to look at and be excited about to try to make educated guesses Here is a teaser… When Volkswagen Squoze it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world Gamestop doing the same would put it’s price north of $31 800 on it’s way to the moon not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark If you needed one more reason to HODL it’s this… you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now even if you went into a Comma and your wife’s boyfriend lost your password couldn’t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze because at $191 a share GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside And if you’ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects… I think I figured it out x200B Please Be Good To Each Other Out There Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories If you need one more reason to HODL I have had a terminally ill child no I do not want anything from any of you that has a life expectancy of 25ish she's 9 She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant toddler which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make A Wish the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community On the r/ PoGo board when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make A Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life From volunteers who attended the event 400 costumed members to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story Why do I bring this up I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18 Travel the world Experience as much as she can If you need one more reason to HODL GME I'm not selling until I can give her that Don’t lose who you are in the wealth that may or maybe not suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes Let’s make the world a better place Not financial advice I don’t know how the stock market works I don’t know how companies or their fundamentals work I bashed the keyboard a bunch of times and this popped out The only thing I know for certain is I bake a mean

MEME REPOSTED REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit about a DRYS short squeeze and this caused the automoderator to delete it Sorry Also since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis here's a rectification 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🌙💎👐 First let's look at the players involved here The shorts On the short side we have some hedge funds most notably Melvin and Citadel who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain The Market Makers may have some overlap with the shorts Marker makers write options contracts to be allowed to buy call or sell put shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date They collect a fee for selling those contracts but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless because then they get to keep their fee and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money How does this work Well for example when GME was trading around $40 they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800 so the fools who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls or so they thought More on this later The longs On the long side we have you glorious apes 🦍 🦍 🦍 Cohen and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts especially if they can make some money while doing so Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this It all started when the shorts were getting greedy and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster They did not expect gamestop would survive covid and they did everything in their power to make it so Shorting the company to the ground with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax free profit It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3 $4 but DID NOT If they did not cover at $3 or $4 what makes you think they covered at $40 $400 Hint they didn't In fact they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400 was just a gamma squeeze In other words they have not even begun to cover yet Then some people liked the stock Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250 and 967 something like 200 million to 500 million shares short Some people may think this is insane but if you do the math you will see that no matter what FINRA says it's impossible for short interest to be below 200 and it's more likely to be around 500 600 It's hard to find reliable data but if you just look at the volume and price action it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th not decreased It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered It simply doesn't add up How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze Some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k just as people doubted it could reach $1000s But here is why those numbers are not only likely but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW feel free to call me an idiot but if I'm right I'll expect apologies First let's look at the option interest source x200B Strike Open interest March 12th Open interest 19th Shares

words they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40 they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th However now that chance is approaching 1 and climbing The MMs still don't need to cover fully but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely So for each option remember each option is 100 shares they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1 chance of it happening But this very act may CAUSE it to happen At some point this is a self fulfilling prophecy Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up the price actually goes up which means they need to insure even more which creates a snowball effect All the way up to or beyond the last option which is at strike price $800 Similarly the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5 likely that GME would hit 300 this week but now it's more like 95 like which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300 they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 which means about a million shares bought which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 then they will DEFINITLY make a loss At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300 they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses Remember all parties are TRYING to make money but not all of them succeed So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days and looking at the above table this will likely push the price towards and likely over $800 either this week or next week You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers for example $300 $350 $400 $420 $500 and of course $800 as you can see some of those numbers are close and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE Now what about the short squeeze Some people ask Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over and buy when the price drops back to normal levels Simple answer they can't Melvin was already down 53 the last time and they didn't even cover that was just a gamma squeeze by their own words When a hedge fund has a short position they can keep that position as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically like in the event of a gamma squeeze they will be FORCED to buy As an example let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share Now the price goes to $1000 per share so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts This is an unacceptable risk as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted However this very act will drive up the price if you want to know how read up on order books and slippage this post is getting long enough as it is In fact this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53 and still didn't cover it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble I'm pretty sure that's illegal So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY regardless of costs Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air So TL DR it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts one way or another Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares while only about 50 million or fewer are available this will be name your price kind of prices This is where $100k is NOT a meme IMPORTANT LAST POINT Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future Remember it doesn't cost us anything to HODL but it does cost them a lot to SHORT Every day they are losing MILLIONS Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us Edit those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high DRYS went to $1 5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze Let that sink in That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant

$RIDE with Lordstown – Huge catalyst this weekend and a chart ready for a break-out 🚀 🚀 🚀,1275,mqa20t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqa20t/ride_with_lordstown_huge_catalyst_this_weekend/,955,1618372180.0,$RIDE with Lordstown – Huge catalyst this weekend and a chart ready for a break out 🚀 🚀 🚀 Disclosure The following represents my opinion EDIT 6 09pm EST Typically edits are at the end of the post but I had to add this link in at the top because they just released this hype video for their race Saturday Spoiler alert this race is the catalyst that I discuss in my post 🚀 🚀 🚀 x200B Intro I work at a tech company that focuses on market research for our clients so I have developed a very extensive and thorough research process during my career I have found that this skill has translated into success in the stock market and I wanted to take the time to show you why my research recently led me to $RIDE So if you decide to read this post from beginning to end you can thank me around Christmas time as $RIDE stock is currently being held down by shorts and FUD but it will be a 4 bagger before the end of this year The great thing about all of this market volatility lately has been the buying opportunities Let me also remind you that this is wallstreetbets not wallstreetbonds If you’re afraid of taking risks why are you a member of this sub anyway I personally have no interest in putting my money in index funds or buying the blue chip value stocks that Cramer loves recommending to boomers I primarily look at fundamentals when making investments but I actually saw a post on this sub last week which really peaked my interest in the technicals of $RIDE too And when I feel that a stock with rock solid fundamentals is bottoming out that’s when I go in big And I won’t go in big unless I feel there’s a huge catalyst on the horizon that can send the stock to pluto 🚀 🚀 🚀 x200B $RIDE – Brief Overview Lordstown Motors Corp $RIDE was founded in 2019 and began developing their full size all electric Endurance truck They got a jump start relative to other competitors due to GM’s investment in exchange for their massive 6 2 million square foot facility $RIDE assembled an experienced management team with multiple executives VPs from companies like Tesla Volkswagen Honda Workhorse etc What these executives realized is that the general public isn’t ready for the mass adoption of electric vehicles right now So the way to hit the ground running in this industry is to sell their electric trucks to commercial fleets Commercial fleets are literally the perfect fit for electrification This is because when a construction worker gets back from a long day at the job site he can just plug his truck in to charge overnight before heading back to work the next day Additionally electric trucks come with a 25 30 lower total cost of ownership This is largely because of lower maintenance costs for EVs and in $RIDE’s case their truck gets 75mpg equivalent which is over 3x the mpg that a pick up usually gets Fleet managers care about efficiency and cost – so $RIDE makes their truck a no brainer for fleets Once their trucks are on the open market this September every fleet manager and their brother will be buying these 🚀 🚀 🚀 I also mentioned a huge upcoming catalyst earlier in this post I saw an article last week that the $RIDE April 23 $20 call had some of the highest implied volatility out of all equity options that day I did some digging and I was able to find the hidden catalyst $RIDE is showing their level of confidence in their truck THIS SATURDAY 4/17 by participating in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off road race The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and it will be publicly televised This is called a Proof of Concept POC and it will showcase why $RIDE’s truck is a fleet manager’s dream No other EV companies out there have the fucking balls to sign their trucks up for something like this $RIDE has been preparing for the race and if their truck even crosses the finish line on Saturday it will be the first EV ever to do so and it will show just how tough the truck actually is thus proving all of the doubters wrong x200B 20 reasons to invest in $RIDE x200B 1 The government is proposing massive infrastructure spend This is a game changer for EV stocks like $RIDE It’s also huge for the construction industry which consists of thousands of fleets that utilize full size pick up trucks x200B 2 Bringing the first full size electric pick up to market The Endurance this September The bestselling 3 vehicles in the US are pick up trucks – many of which operate in fleet sector $RIDE is laser focused on the light duty vehicle market – which will represent nearly a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2025 x200B 3 Backed by GM who sold them a 6 2 million square foot facility over 2 years ago now for pennies on the dollar 3rd most productive automotive plant in the country x200B 4 Utilizes revolutionary all electric In Wheel Drive System with four hub motors integrated software This will change the automotive industry for decades to come Aside from $RIDE Lexus is considering using this technology as well x200B 5 Partnered with Camping World partnership will allow $RIDE to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US instant ability to scale across country This will give fleets the peace of mind knowing there are locations all over the country to get their vehicles fixed if there are issues x200B 6 They will be able to create multiple vehicles with the same core components because of the simplicity of their state of the art skateboard chassis This creates insanely high production efficiency They’re already planning to release design for their next vehicle a van this summer x200B 7 Marcus Lemonis CEO of Camping World tweeted a leak two weeks ago of the $RIDE RV that is being worked on in conjunction with Camping World The electric RV market is going to be huge x200B 8 Already have more than 500 employees and will be up to 1500 employees by production this September x200B 9 Announced an agreement with Holman Enterprises – a fleet provider that manages 2 million vehicles An analyst commented that this agreement alone would generate over 12 000 orders x200B 10 Signed a multi year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution a global leader in battery cell technology to broaden their high quality diverse battery cell supply chain These are “Tesla batteries ” x200B 11 GM and LG are building a battery plant right across the street from $RIDE’s facility Think about the efficiency of being next door neighbors with your battery supplier x200B 12 If celebrity endorsements are your thing Joe Burrow and Guy Fieri like to $RIDE x200B 13 At max capacity the $RIDE facility will be able to produce up to 600 000 vehicles each year x200B 14 An article from February that I dug up quoted the $RIDE Director of Government Relations Corporate Affairs Chris Kerzich There was a quote from Chris that said “Right now it's going to take us a couple of years to fulfill that demand And that demand does not even include Federal and state vehicles which those have to go through a procurement process so we are primarily focused right now on meeting the commercial demand that we have x200B 15 Have been testing their skateboard chassis in both desert conditions and snowy conditions x200B 16 Have over $600m cash on hand which is more than enough to get to full production this September x200B 17 Have hit fully automated beta production meaning robots are welding their vehicles means they are very close to fully automated mass production x200B 18 Yesterday a video was shown of vehicles being sent out for additional crash testing x200B 19 In the final due diligence stage for the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program Receiving this loan would be a huge catalyst for the stock and an announcement is expected any day now It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means the DOE has been taking a deep dive into their financials operations and personnel If they are awarded the loan this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring x200B 20 The 6 month chart shows $RIDE has made this same violent move downward multiple times and each time made a violent move upwards shortly after I will now explain why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity x200B $RIDE – A time of FUD creates a massive buying opportunity Okay so what kind of DD would this be if I didn’t explain to you why the stock has plunged close to 70 from all time highs I want to walk you through the 2 main things that brought the stock down and show you why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity 1 Short seller Hindenburg Research targeted $RIDE in a research report last month Piece of advice – never believe a short seller until you do your own DD They obviously want retail investors to panic and sell the stock so they can make money on their short position After all Hindenburg is literally just a 5 man shop ran out of an apartment in New York I think their ego got too big after they successfully shorted Nikola Feel free to check out this post because it refuted all of Hindenburg’s main accusations against $RIDE You know a short seller is full of BS when the state of Ohio comes to the defense of the attacked company At the bottom of this article Senator Michael Rulli discusses how far along $RIDE is and says “anyone who was in that plant would read that short report and think it was garbage ” Additionally U S Rep Tim Ryan called the short report a “bull hatchet job for the short seller to make money ” Secretary of State Frank LaRose also visited $RIDE’s facility to confirm how legit this operation is Plus Ohio Governor Dewine’s Grandson works at Lordstown as a Government Affairs Lobbyist This shows that the state of Ohio is backing $RIDE It helps to have friends in the right places during times like this 2 Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry Basically there are a couple of lawsuits and an SEC probe that are looking into $RIDE’s pre orders $RIDE claimed to have 100 000 non binding reservations and there are now questions about whether or not these pre orders are legit This does not concern me Like I mentioned earlier $RIDE Director of Government Relations Corporate Affairs Chris Kerzich already made it clear that demand is robust and it will take them “a couple of years” to fulfill the current demand All of this has been blown out of proportion based on my research Here’s a link of some current SEC probes There are a lot of companies you know very well that are being looked at by the SEC constantly The reality is there are 1000’s of SEC inquiries each year into publicly traded companies The end result is almost always a slap on the wrist Let’s take Tesla for example Do you remember a couple of years ago when Elon tweeted he was going to take $TSLA private at $420 a share which was a premium to the share price at the time That was literally stock market manipulation by Elon and it was probably one of the most illegal things a public company could do There were dozens of lawsuits and a full blown SEC investigation Well the end result was literally just a $20 million fine for Elon and a $20 million fine for $TSLA Basically a slap on the wrist And that was 100x more serious than $RIDE’s non binding pre orders The point I’m making is this Don’t be fooled by the media They make lawsuits and SEC involvement seem way worse than they actually are Do your homework and invest in companies with high growth potential when times of FUD create buying opportunities Look at institutional investment too Morningstar and Fintel show that institutions have consistently been adding $RIDE to their holdings the past couple of months x200B Conclusion $RIDE is an EV growth company currently trading at a large discount 50 of their asset value They have a $3B facility and over $600m cash on hand but only a $1 8B market cap after the recent sell off Please view this investor presentation for any additional questions on the company $RIDE is massively oversold right now $RIDE short of float is now over 21 as of today which is exactly the fuel we need for a massive move upwards after the Baja race this Saturday 🚀 🚀 🚀 Remember Bulls make money bears make money but pigs get slaughtered To me it is apparent that shorts have gotten greedy on $RIDE They will be forced to cover big time with this huge catalyst coming so soon x200B Position 3868 shares $12 22 I believe this stock will be back to its 52 week high of $32 by the end of this summer and it will be $40 by production in September $RIDE currently has one of the lowest market caps $1 8B out of all of the EV plays yet they are the closest to mass production They also have a huge catalyst coming this Saturday Lots of upside here x200B TL DR $RIDE stock currently presents a great entry point People who are doubting American EV stocks are probably the same people who didn’t believe the internet was the next big thing back in the 90’s It’s very clear that EVs are the future and $RIDE has a huge opportunity ahead 🚀 🚀 🚀 There is a reason the $RIDE April 23 $20 call has such high implied volatility This is because they have a massive catalyst THIS SATURDAY 4/17 They signed up their truck for one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off road race The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and it will be publicly televised Load the boat on shares of $RIDE and get ready to see a bunch of green in the coming weeks and months ,2021-04-14 06:49:40,

"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1753,og6ofy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/,940,1625777878.0,Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire a follow up to my Market Crash Post So I made this post about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking both in the comments and messages about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000 2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts In 2000 California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices power companies were failing and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week but not this week and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC etc etc Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy Except here's the kicker Crazy conspiracy guy was 100 right Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money When the blackouts and price spikes were happening Cali had 45GW of installed power and demand was running at 28GW Fuckery was afoot So whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market I always wonder is there a reason for this Or is it Fuckery Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math In 2004 roughly the peak of US homeownership rates the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69 In 2021 it's at 65 In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US In 2021 it's 141 million US population in 2004 was 292 million In 2021 it's 331 million Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get A 13 increase in population a 4 decrease in homeownership rate and a 15 increase in housing supply Yes that's right the housing supply has increased faster than the population and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from Are people making more money Nope Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79 in 2004 to 77 in 2021 So in real terms wages are down Is it immigrants Nope immigration has been falling for years Is it young people starting families Nope family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40 are 20 poorer than boomers were at their age Is it inflation Nope bond yields are currently signaling deflation but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows So basically you've got more supply relative to population construction of new units is slowing down 1 8 million starts in Jan to 1 7 million starts in March down to 1 6 million starts in May prices are rising and sales are slowing Jan 6 5 million existing home sales 993 000 new home sales May 5 8 million existing home sales 769 000 new home sales So to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows Prices Up Wages Down Supply relative to population Up Demand Down Sales Down Construction Down Yeah it's a fucking bubble And clearly Fuckery is Afoot Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control maybe it's AirBnB maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's maybe it's something else entirely but it's definitely a bubble and it's definitely Fuckery TLDR Fuckery is Afoot It's a bubble Don't buy a house until the market crashes And remember millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again Positions same as the last post puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market One last nugget about housing Residential Fixed Investment it's a recession indicator the acronym is apparently a banned ticker was declining before the COVID crash we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash My date range remains unchanged sometime between June and November of this year If you want some specific dates to watch check July 12th July 19th August 23rd September 20th and October 25th I probably like August 23rd the most of those but I buy retard positions on WSB so you definitely shouldn't listen to me EDIT Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies Got my first pump and dump shill DM so that's an achievement unlocked I guess I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards Half the goddamn replies are housing is up where I live so there's no bubble The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half Bro THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING Like the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing Pure WSB retardation gold there To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot renters ARE accounted for so are multifamily households That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate 40 million people and 20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone And spoiler they aren't The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters EDIT2 because I'm seeing a lot of but people own more than one house posts A pair of quotes I own six houses And a condo THERE'S A BUBBLE

CLOV DD - No Bullshit,1895,mtkyw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtkyw2/clov_dd_no_bullshit/,938,1618807161.0,CLOV DD No Bullshit CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days To sum that up FactSet top financial data provider had the CLOV float listed as 23 5M and short interest at 39M putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146 6 This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday Factset has since updated the float to 109 8M making the 39M short interest account for 36 of the float They previously had deducted the CEO’s class B shares from the total class A shares and although his shares are “non tradeable” and shouldn't be included in the public float they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non tradeable unless converted so shouldn’t have been part of the equation to begin with Now I could get more into the Hindenberg said this” and “S3 said this” bullshit that people have been arguing about But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap like Factset updating the short float to 36 destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank BULLSHIT here’s why The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31 Over two weeks ago When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks With 30M short volume on 4/8 and 90M short volume on Friday according to Fintel We don’t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest but given all this you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high For context 36 short float based on outdated short interest from 3/31 is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle and it’s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise end of story Now let’s get into the shit that really matters First off from a technical perspective there are some good signs if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section MACD bullish RSI only starting to warm up Decent support built between $7 $7 30 But what’s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows Now let’s get into call volume Some of the order that came through Friday Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons 1 it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2 the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze x200B Next CLOV is down over 50 from Dec/Jan highs Some of the main reasons for the drop would be Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS Hindenberg short report Short seller price manipulation The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50 in the weeks following its release Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales as evidence stating that in 2016 “Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ” Well just this month April 8th the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website see picture below The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn’t hold up as the same federal agency CMS they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states Which is huge news for CLOV by the way x200B Wrapping this up Now say what you will about Chamath but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze He promoted it posted his personal positions and while Wall Street CNBC and others attacked Gamestop Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC’s were the target of short attacks shortly after but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target x200B No one knows what will happen in the market I sure as hell don’t but given all that's been laid out here I like the stock $CLOV to $100 x200B EDIT anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME it's not Holding GME love the setup going into this week Also this is not financial advice do your own DD blah blah blah And for those asking about my position I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance x200B Update 4/20 people asking if they should sell You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you Nothing has changed The market dumped and people sold If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control Long term my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy Dips are opportunities Not worried I like the stock Make your own decision ,2021-04-19 07:39:21,4.

Financial Crime of the Century and how to play GME going forward This is an extension of my DD series on GME I have been investing in learning about and following GME since September 2020 and in that time I have learned many things It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime In this post I’ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here about shorts and my thoughts on the future of GME I’ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward TL DR The squeeze has been reset Shorts have re set their short positions at much higher sell points and longs have likely cycled through I don’t believe a VW style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share Fuck “diamond handing” I’m starting to accumulate shares again I share below how I’m trading GME Previous Important Posts If you haven’t read them and have time they will provide some background on my previous analysis EndGame Part 1 DTC Infinity covered the short positions the float and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close EndGame Part 2 covered Cohen fair market cap analysis and potential investors in which I talked about the amazing mid to long term potential for GME After the Citron tweet I shared this fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts on the day of the tweet and offered some education on strengthening your position This one got buried and is worth reading EndGame Part 3 covered the gamma squeeze potential shady tactics by MMs and some tips for staying safe EndGame Part 4 covered the continued gamma squeezing and the resulting tenuous position of the 50M shorts that were still in GME EndGame Part 5 deleted by mods posted by someone else in comments went into the implications of the absolute mindfuck trick the shorts pulled when they limited buying of GME and other heavily shorted stocks Important External Reading These three non reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the DTCC/NSCC to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value representing what is probably one of the greatest financial crimes of the century Anatomy of a Short Attack Seeking Alpha article from 2014 Can’t link it Search for it Key tactics that shorts use and have used on GME Flooding the offer side of the board Leveraging counterfeit shares Media assault see my post on coordinated put buying with the Citron post and pay special attention to media treatment of GME to drive down sentiment Analyst reports BofA coming out with a ridiculously low price target Frivolous SEC investigations meant to distract the SEC Like this one filed against DFV/Roaring Kitty Pulling margin from long customers Illegal Naked Shorting DTCC continuous net settlement and stock borrowing programs have loopholes that facilitate illegal naked shorting “There is an integral relationship between the DTCC and hedge funds On regulation SHO “However Wall Street has a bag of tricks to get around this requirement One of which is simply to ignore it Another is to roll the position to another broker dealer Oftentimes fails to deliver can last for months or years The SEC seems strangely unwilling or unable to enforce this provision of Regulation SHO ” “How phantom shares on Wall Street threaten U S Companies and investors” March 2020 This article is a bombshell a former DTCC employee whistleblowing fraud in relationships with DTCC and short funds What’s happening with GME happened before with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac “ evidence that more shares were sold than ever existed ” “The main problem is that Reg SHO has no real teeth for enforcement The brokers are never called to be responsible for their behavior ” Banks play by different rules “The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks/broker dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short selling ban in place – but only for the shares of banks insurance companies and securities firms including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system ” “Who controls the DTCC The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC‘s services who process trades there who fail to deliver there are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors ” History of shares and shorts on $GME Here’s some history on GME that’s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today GME used to have many many more shares outstanding Back in 2009 there were over 160M shares outstanding and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements concluding with a massive share 40 buyback in 2019 pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares x200B When you look at a price history chart you need to factor this in So when GME’s share price was $50 in 2008 its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50 /share GME used to be in the S P 500 It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B In 2016 there were about 25M shares shorted of GME It’s very likely GME was shorted out of the S P Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks In 2019 GME bought back and retired 40 of their shares yet amazingly the short interest increased How is it possible that shorted shares if not naked did not have to find new borrows to cover How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period x200B How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares At the same time shorts increased their short position by 20M shares How is this possible How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float x200B Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015 By April 2020 GME had dropped to under $3 and shorts were sitting on billions in profit Why not take profits A little known tax loophole allows hedge funds to pay no taxes if a company they shorted goes bankrupt as they do not need to close the trade so the profit is not realized Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges Maplelene capital Melvin others are all Steve Cohen cronies Who bailed out Melvin Steve Cohen There are many strange connections between DTCC’s actions and shorts As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood’s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME At that point more than 50 of Robinhood’s users had GME Robinhood is only worth around $10B The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution Key question Who suggested the buying halt Was it Vlad Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements Sounds very much like a “turn off buying or else” kind of arrangement Keep in mind that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing upwards of $50B as GME was well on its way over $500/share So Citadel doesn’t care about shooting down Robinhood It’s a minor toe amputation to save their leg The 4am call from the DTCC happened 2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin and 1 day after the put call ratio for GME flipped 3 1 for puts not only was this coordinated shorts knew this was coming and profited from it If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts you’d know something interesting Why GME went up Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high Let me try and explain this First the current price of an equity is just the last traded price This is a very very critical piece you need to understand When there are 70M shares outstanding and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to volume When there’s high trading volume relative to total float it’s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value In the case of GME supply and demand is the critical driver of price As I mentioned in EndGame Part 1 the true supply of GME shares tradable float is ridiculously low The demand side comes in 4 parts Value buyers people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was Squeeze buyers people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else needing to pay more Shorts covering shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them MM hedging repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME For a normal equity most of that demand side does not exist Low supply high demand high price That’s why GME shot up The Big Reset This wasn’t just a squeeze this was a massive reset on investors long and short for GME Any SEC filings 13G/13F showing positions prior to Feb 1 are irrelevant other than insider positions It’s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze and likely many shorts covered Some of those longs that liquidated may re invest and some of the shorts that covered may re short Shorts were given a huge bailout whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices with GME currently sitting at $49/share a 90 reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th However this is not the end for GME Everything started with value on GME At $50 we’re back to a value play GME’s market cap is now under $4B Remember that GME has over $1B in e commerce revenue alone every year and e commerce is growing at 300 For more on market cap potential go see EndGame Part 2 or the excellent gmedd com Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business or the prospects for a Cohen led revitalization so if you were in this for Cohen at $20 35 we’re not too far off from that right now If people can afford to hold their shares the float continues to shrink Wild cards remain in order of decreasing likelihood Cohen still needs to buy his 7 He’s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he’s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares They are not buying in at squeeze entry points Key point When insiders buy shares their shares are removed from the lending pool This is part of the GME corporate bylaws I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1 0 as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen’s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board Regulatory involvement It’s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails to deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME Share recalls for a vote There are a number of reasons this could happen I think it’s unlikely but if this were to happen non naked shorts would need to cover People moving out of Robinhood to brokers that can stop lending their shares After this shitshow I moved a few thousand shares out of RH I didn’t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account but interestingly Robinhood’s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site Try clicking on “downgrade” under Robinhood Cash here Shady AF How I’m thinking about GME now This is going to sound extremely strange but I’ve never been more excited to lose money I am holding several thousand shares in GME but my position is only about 25 of my desired position and I can’t wait to buy GME at lower prices I hadn’t bought any shares since $35 see my part 2 when I said I went all in and sold on the way up to take some profit but I’m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125 None of this squeeze drama broker drama etc changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place I think that the core short thesis of “GME is another blockbuster destined for death” is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re rating of the company Since part 2 some interesting developments have happened at GME including the addition of new officers of the company more Chewy execs and one ex Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO I don’t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing Think about it if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer Big plans are afoot folks $4B for GME is cheap That being said I’m hoping for a further dip I’m selling puts from 40 down to 10 hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can and to take advantage of the still insanely high IV Suggestions This is going to be a long fight It is painful for all of us regardless of your cost of entry because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free Instead funds clearinghouses brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market Here’s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward Take advantage of IV while it is high While IV is still high sell puts if you want to add sell calls to reduce your cost basis For example I sold 2/26 9p for like $0 5 that’s a 6 return on capital in less than a month and either I own GME at $9 awesome or I keep the premium also good I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here which will not happen quickly if ever So I’m selling calls against my remaining shares I also sold some Nov 70p for $42 Let me explain this trade for those of you that don’t sell puts normally Selling puts gets a bad wrap of “pennies in front of a steamroller” but this is not the case with GME if you do it right Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november total of $7000 So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put Two scenarios So in my mind this is a trade that “can’t go tits up” “Downside” risks Have your own price target Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add and above which it makes sense to trim If you are in need of some research here see gmedd com I also wrote my own long term bull targets in EndGame Part 2 Buy low not high folks don’t fomo Stop sharing your positions publicly I know this is anti wsb and I think sharing them is great for this community but in the case of GME it’s an attack vector for you Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration Remember the multiple trading halts What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day All your calls would expire worthless Depending on your broker and your cash positions maybe even your ITM ones Roll or sell if you’re taking profits your weeklies well before expiration Get the F out of Robinhood While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily They lend your shares to shorts and don’t pay you for it margin call you when you’re winning sell your shares at absolute lows and pass all your data to Citadel I don’t think the “free” commissions are really free RH is worse for your financial future Minimize regret don’t maximise profitability I sold some shares “early” on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit I missed all the peaks never sold any shares above $400 but holding out for “maximum profit” led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing you can be surprised by a new trick If you bet it all on weeklies all at once you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out I’ve held through multiple 50 drawdowns in the underlying you need to be ready for the volatility Watch out for stop loss hunts It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares If you’ve set a stop loss be really sure about it Don’t sell on dips You’re only helping the shorts If you need to sell to take profits sell when it’s heading up Sell high not low retards Save dry powder to buy on dips Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points GME has incredible daily volatility Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill Have patience when buying This is not financial advice do your own DD I’m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive Bonus If I was Maxine Waters what would I ask On February 18th Congress will be interviewing Robinhood Melvin Citadel and DFV Here are some questions I’d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public under oath Dear Vlad 1 Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before 2 How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one 3 Who suggested the solution of restricting buying Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued 4 To his knowledge are there any historical

reported figures it is estimated that over 400 Tesla employees contracted SARS CoV 2 between May and December 2020 Boudette 2021 Analysis of COVID 19 Response Tesla’s source of value is derived from automotive sales of the Model 3 and the Model Y both of which are only manufactured in Fremont CA and Shanghai China Going into 2020 Tesla only had $8 2 billion in quick assets and $10 7 billion in quick liabilities Tesla Financial Statements n d With a quick ratio of 0 76 Tesla was in a vulnerable position when the COVID 19 pandemic started Shutting down the Fremont factory in accordance with state law would likely have been catastrophic to Tesla’s financial health as the company has often been in a precarious financial balance between solvency and insolvency Note Tesla has nearly gone bankrupt in 2008 2014 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 Elon has a gift for doing magic tricks and buying himself more time This uncertain situation is likely what drove Elon Musk to be so defiant about the company’s operations and eventually caused him to rebel against the state’s legal measures to shut down all but essential businesses of which Tesla is not This is also the likely motivation behind the stock dilution seen in Q3 and Q4 2020 when Tesla issued more stock and raised $12 686 billion Tesla Financial Statements n d A curious observation is found when looking at the cash flow from operating activities and comparing it to cash flow from financing activities Year over year Tesla is a company that consistently subsists itself through financing activity not operating activity Tesla Financial Statements n d When looking over all of the relevant information it is clear that Tesla did what it had to do in order to remain solvent However it is also clear that they were entirely fixated on staying operational at any cost even if it meant its own employees were put at risk of infection from SARS CoV 2 Employees should re evaluate their relationship with Tesla and decide if the company views them as an asset or an expendable resource Tesla’s efforts in this regard were found wanting SWOT Analysis Tesla’s strength is really down to the cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk For better or for worse without Elon Musk’s personal brand Tesla would have gone bankrupt long ago because it is not a sustainable business model Tesla has survived through a combination of a secular bull market dovish monetary policy generous fiscal policy corporate welfare and legions of wishful thinking investors Strauss Smith 2019 The weakness surrounding Tesla is that despite what seems to be carefully crafted earnings management the core business of Tesla is not profitable and may never be profitable A counter argument may be that other automotive manufacturers also have razor thin margins and not the best balance sheets This is a fair argument but it is important to point out that Ford Motors and General Motors have vastly higher revenues than Tesla and they rely on cash flow from operating activities not financing activities to stay solvent There are many threats that Tesla is facing Tesla has many eerie similarities to Enron NYSE ENE Enron executives were publicly hostile towards short sellers and Elon Musk is particularly vocal about his disdain for short sellers Niedermeyer 2019 Enron was routinely hailed as a futuristic innovative disruptor that was changing the world Note You can read more about this in Niedermeyer's book Also read more here here and here Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle EV than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers As such they will continue to take market share away from Tesla and may eventually take over the company MacDuffie 2018 While China has been seen as the promised land for Tesla's profitability China has many state sponsored investments into their own companies such as XPeng Kharpal 2021 and Nio Nio Motors Has n d From a geopolitical perspective it is unlikely that the Chinese government will allow a U S business to dominate their own EV market Note they absofuckingloutely will not allow this to happen The opportunity that Tesla really has is the new administration in Washington D C which has recently unveiled a bill entitled “The American Jobs Plan” American Jobs Plan 2021 which will invest up to $3 trillion over the next 15 years Much of this bill will involve infrastructure and clean energy initiatives This is something that Tesla will undoubtedly capitalize on and enjoy the juicy resources provided to them courtesy of the U S taxpayer Regardless of sentiment this fresh capital influx will likely stimulate the company’s operations and allow them to continue operations for the foreseeable future Recommendations and Predictions Using a valuation based on comparable firms Berk et al 2017 Tesla’s intrinsic value is much closer to $32 82/per share with a current book value of $24 03 Tesla Financial Statements n d With 959 854 000 shares outstanding this fair value would give Tesla a more realistic market capitalization of $31 5 billion Tesla Financial Statements n d This market capitalization would be comparable to other auto manufacturers like Ford and General Motors However this represents a 95 decrease in the current market price of Tesla This would still be a generous valuation for Tesla as at $32 82 per share because the PE ratio would be around 51 and still far higher than the industry average of around 24 To be even more generous one could give Tesla a valuation based upon the discounted free cash flow DFCF method Berk et al 2017 This would give Tesla a market capitalization of $312 9 billion and a valuation of $325 89 per share yet this is still 51 86 lower than where the market is currently pricing the stock at This DFCF valuation uses a discount rate of 11 and operates on the assumption that Tesla’s earnings will grow by 50 every single year through 2026 before leveling off at a 10 earnings growth rate from 2027 onward This simply is not practical as Tesla’s revenue growth has only been forecasted to grow at 33 every year through 2023 It is safe to say that Tesla has already been “priced to perfection” and then some While the story of Tesla has largely been a successful example of “fake it until you make it” reality will eventually catch up to Tesla whose brand is inseparable from the brand of Elon Musk Were this a street report the coverage would be initiated with a “Strong Sell” recommendation and a $33 00 price target In order for Tesla to justify its unreasonable valuation the company will need to demonstrate that it can achieve sustainable profitability without the extensive use of government welfare in the form of rebates and subsidies that are paid for by U S taxpayers To that end it needs to increase operating margin expansion and drive new revenue growth through licensing The licensing of its proprietary software and intellectual property to other automotive manufacturers might be its only saving grace in the years to come as more experienced auto manufacturers take market share from Tesla in the EV space References American Jobs Plan 2021 April 08 Retrieved April 10 2021 from Berk J DeMarzo P Harford J 2017 Fundamentals

An Illiad of GME Technical Analysis and DD,11058,ma4oeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4oeo/an_illiad_of_gme_technical_analysis_and_dd/,870,1616385434.0,An Illiad of GME Technical Analysis and DD Apes gorillas cucks tards and degenerates gather round Uncle Hank has some more technical DD to bestow on your smooth brains Please bear bull with me because this will be long Some of you have probably seen my other posts and this will be much the same however this technical analysis will be more in depth and will cover a wider ranger of indicators than previous posts I am a technical trader and these are the indicators that I have used in the past and that I have found helpful but this is in no way exhaustive and there are many other indicators and trading styles that are just as useful as these Finally I am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice my brain is literally a senile amoeba As you can probably tell I have an ADHD medicine prescription I worked very hard on this and hope that you apes enjoy it Volume catalysts I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME Let me be clear volume is king Volume is god Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend that might be an understatement tbh If you look at GME's chart every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume This is not unique to GME as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price x200B Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike as with any stock The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side Again this is not exclusive to GME When a stock has a great earnings report acquisition news FDA approval etc you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase or decrease in price Now you're probably thinking to yourself ok Uncle Hank but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase Well volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock so that begs the question what makes more people buy or sell a stock Catalysts We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds so when there is news demand spikes while supply is still low I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this First here is a pic of GME's volume since January I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY x200B The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME The first big spike on here is in early January 11 13th ish which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board This is when people were like ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention The next jump which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum This is where things really started to kick off After this there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets Chamath support Mark Cuban talking to us media coverage and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100 This was the frenzy of late January After that everything died down regarding volume price and media attention HOWEVER the volume picked back up and price corresponded when GME ousted their CFO Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this Full disclosure I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time and this showed me its true power We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company Since then volume has gone down The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is x200B So now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME When people talk about X will move GME they are saying that the event will create positive volume which will allow GME to rise So what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise Earnings is obviously the closest one The actual numbers don't really matter here If GME beats significantly it might cause a rise but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call On the conference call if we hear news about the digital transformation acquisitions a new CFO or anything relating to Cohen there will be massive volume and a price increase If those things are not discussed on the earnings call then they will be catalysts in the next few months If GME appoints a new CFO I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one If Cohen gets appointed CEO oh get fucking ready So now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of the squeeze might happen here or the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume OBV But Uncle Hank what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes Glad you asked that's where OBV comes into play OBV on balance volume is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price keep that idea in the back of your head For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade precedes means it comes before OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation In this calculation the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total which is denoted by a line depending on if it's negative or positive this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total If a candle is neutral the volume of that candle will not be added Thankfully GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile If it's positive the volume is added to the total if it's negative the volume is subtracted from the total For example these are random numbers don't start eating your crayons yet let's say a given stock's OBV is 1 000 Then there is a negative candle with a volume of 2 The OBV would now be 998 Then there is a positive candle with a volume of 100 The OBV would now be 1098 This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume OBV is a trend indicator remember volume proceeds price so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant rather the trend of OBV is what matters Because volume proceeds price OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles IMO OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating and oh would you look at that GME is consolidating If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing that is an indication that when it breaks the trend it will be high The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing Generally if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing you can expect it to continue that trend If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing you can expect it to go negative in the future This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price The below pic shows GME's OBV the yellow line on different time scales x200B So what does this mean Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase If you look at the 1 year and 90 day charts you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze However OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January This means that the green candles the uptrends have higher volume than the red candles the downtrends This is extremely bullish We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30 day and 10 day charts OBV is still increasing which means that there is much more volume on the buy side than the sell side Even with all of these monster short attacks like the one we saw last week there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV which further adds to the bullish sentiment Personally I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest but more importantly I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit Furthermore many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated Though this may be true to an extent they move similarly but not identically OBV is much more bullish for GME AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet As stated above GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now This is not to bash AMC I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid parabolic upward move So now you understand that volume is king we need volume for GME to increase volume is not increasing but OBV is still increasing This is good SPY and VIX Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta I've seen 2 8 and even 13 Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market if the market is up it is up proportionately A negative beta however means the opposite It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction If you've seen some of the other DDs you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX SPY and VIX are the purple lines first one is VIX second is SPY Though the correlation is not perfect you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence high volume and volatility which are exactly what GME needs Lucky for us SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10 year bond which will push the stock market down Essentially the market is overbought needs to pull back is overinflated and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation Again volume is more important than this but this is just something good to keep in line Support and resistance x200B In this section I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed Again sorry for all of the lines I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory so I cannot help myself The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February We have however since broken that resistance As many of you know previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since Is this because of psychological levels Is it a whale doing that on purpose Is it the hedgies playing games It's impossible to know just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support let's not talk about that and hope we never get there The fat green yellow and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support If we can get above the red line and stay there MOON Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have especially because of how tested it has been Current patterns Looking at the chart I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish First you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles I can 100 see that pattern forming and believe in its merit Since there are so many posts on it I won't waste your time with a picture The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100 This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line x200B As you can see we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that 180ish as our current iron clad support From there I saw a bullish pennant pattern the two orange lines however as many of you know this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support Instead of forming a pennant I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern x200B That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way Now why are these patterns bullish When a stock makes a move upward or downward then consolidates it typically continues that pattern Here is an explanation of that x200B As you can see the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory which I am a huge supporter of Just wanted to give a shout out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it If you don't know what EWT is it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements consolidating movements and corrective movements GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement which is bullish I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it With all of this in mind it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them It is moving in a stair step pattern where it shoots up consolidates then uses the previous resistance as support This is extremely bullish TTM Squeeze MACD Ichimoku Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze MACD and Ichimoku These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels It moves similarly to MACD which also predicts momentum Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general so do some research on your own to better understand them Importantly all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME Below I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators because that's how I use them On the one week chart the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend MACD is the two lines indicators When the blue line is over the yellow one it's bullish The wider the distance the more bullish TTM also indicates the start of a very big move When TTM is light blue we are in the stage of the greatest momentum you can see the light blue from late January When we are in a dark blue phase there is still bullish momentum but its dying When we go into a red phase we are in a bearish phase you can see that throughout February Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying From here we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory light blue candles This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes Finally Ichimoku This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud this is an indication of bullish momentum Well would you look at that GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings These three indicators are great on their own but when used together they are even more powerful MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning A note about the short attacks As many of you have seen over the past few days GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday Are these short attacks or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR It's impossible to know This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories Like I said above It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes What we can be sure about however is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands How can I be sure of this Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March As you can see the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands then whoever did the short attack again friend or foe bought the shares back up The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering Again it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell off No stock drops by over 50 two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS If a stock drops this much it's usually because of an investigation missed earnings etc On both of these crashes there was no news on GME at all so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit taking they were 100 coordinated attacks More on why paperhanding is stupid The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis Obviously it's not a good idea for the cause but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock This thing can and will move over 100 points points not percentage in a single day We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour It is understandable that many new traders might for example get in on GME at $100 watch it rise up to $350 then panic sell when it goes below $200 but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that Below I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400 but believe me apes we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future The reason that I have posted this is because though I am feverishly against paperhanding everyone including myself gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected but that paperhanding is not the answer enjoy x200B x200B x200B x200B x200B A Note about squeezes Before I go any further please understand that last time was not a short squeeze Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float The buying pressure creates immense price increases which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover which only increases the buying pressure and price increases This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares gamma squeeze Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time If it did happen you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time It should look similar to the VW short squeeze So anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over look at the chart see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW finish jacking off and thank Uncle Hank To add more to this if the squeeze truly did happen then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50 short interest Why short interest might not matter If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50 like FINRA says I've seen posts that say it's 65 120 200 and even 900 Let me tell you those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing Again I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD and again I agree with it but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is Now I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter This is just a hypothesis feel free to disagree with me below I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts see above because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold Because of this when there is good news on GME all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock which is mostly held by retail traders which creates massive buy pressure Essentially because of WSB users diamond hands every time there is positive news on GME it creates a gamma squeeze Again this is just a hypothesis Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen Yes However I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile In essence diamond hands is fucking working FTD Squeeze I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon which will lead to the actual squeeze I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts If someone could link it in a comment below I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it Also just as another note if you look at iBorrowDesk GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days Borrow rate is still super low but this is just an interesting thing to look at Closing Thots In short I like the stock If there is anything that you take away from this remember volume is king the short squeeze has not happened yet short interest might not matter and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon Again this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor Finally I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account I have always loved investing and trading but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy Thanks a ton apes stay

Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app.,6352,ofo6u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofo6u0/didi_took_13_billion_in_cash_from_american/,862,1625709109.0,Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app And to top it off the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity VIE structure through which foreign investors have invested in Chinese companies For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China see here Wonder if American and other foreign investors will finally get the memo with Didi here If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate they could not have timed this move any better The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company’s operations or business Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10 K Someone lied It's either the CCP or Didi itself which let's be honest is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like This lack of reciprocity cannot continue The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions just as happens here on the flipside in the US recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court Unless and until that happens the lesson is clear stay away from Chinese offerings The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors see here The risk is just not worth it Edit oh right I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago INB4 1 Enron Theranos Your Hometown Deli Lordstown et al Besides the fact Enron was decades ago it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with But more to the point with respect to all of these the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here if they've been injured and lies or fraudulent statements were made then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it including by foreigners who invested in them Theranos like Enron has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one Tell me do you as a foreigner have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for e g fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure Do you as a foreign investor have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud There is no reciprocity And that's the nub of the problem As a foreign investor in China you will get burned and there is nothing you can do about it unlike foreign investors here in the US 2 Ohh silly person China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money leaving them high and dry Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong in violation of a treaty the CCP signed The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4 Yes it injures itself but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven Edit INB4 no 3 You and this post are racist It’s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds I think not Moreover this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media They’ve learned they can deflect from the CCP’s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist Edit edit Hell let’s go even further Assume I am indeed a racist I’m not How does that factually alter rebut or contend with the substance of anything I’ve said here Edit edit edit INB4 no 4 You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud All right Now consider the following A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies so it refuses based on national security grounds Given this linkage between the state and enterprise and given the state's preoccupation with national security an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to national security The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process Not so here in the US where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly traded companies Edit Edit Edit Edit I do not have a position in Didi have not bought or sold a single share or contract Edit x 5 Here is a good Bogleheads primer/discussion on some of the differences between Chinese VIEs and the usual ADRs via which foreign companies are more usually traded ,2021-07-08 04:51:49,7.

ANALysis recently fractals and shit and found out that GeeMEeee is going to fking PENETRATE $1K next week Hope you enjoy the read Yeah you heard it right and you most likely know that already but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen The analysis is build upon fractal techniques so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast Buckle up and eat a Crayon fellow trader the word is used as anagram you know for what as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading and it might even help you with the digestion of the information in the post This is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis 1 Well that's a good question When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan JK leave poor Vlad alone for a moment The fractal from Latin fractus means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern formed by a sequence es of candles which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time frames Fractals are simple yet important repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend Apely speaking fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument Now that the captain is gone let's get to business GME fartcals wroom wroom I know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis Furthermore I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences using simple lines and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it What you see on the chart one candle represents 2 hours of price action above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse 14 16 Jan followed by another turquoise consolidation this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days Next is where the things really start to get interesting 22nd Jan as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially This accelerection does not go quietly erupting into a powerful gap not as big as the one in your head though Finally starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex pay attention to this peak as it will be used for calculations later on the 27th of January 'What Why purple rectangle ' you may ask Easy REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame That was only the left part of the chart Now let's be brief for a moment There were six main components to the fractal base turquoise consolidation magenta uptrend turquoise consolidation 2 magenta impulse gap and purple rectangle What you see on the right is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother Particularly starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests And this is how we really utilize fractals identify the fractal sequence from the previous data on the left and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions on the right Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph don't they Coincidence I think not Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON 1 Here you go boy Allrighty I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of Count to six yes you may use your fingers Twice Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies 1 flat line 2 small magenta hill 3 line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit 4 accelerection 5 your brain aka Gap 6 Valhala REKTangle / GME go BBBBRRRRRRR Good boy/girl you've come this far Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced you may get some rest Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend because we are DIVING DEEPER Ok it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row So I ate a pack this time and I am full of GMEnergy As is the chart below so bullish that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit but the apes have to evolve at one point in history so I really encourage you to use this opportunity In depth fractal forecast I hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title finally Ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable where did A B come from The first and most important notice is that A B fractals are built upon 1 2 3 4 5 6 and on the chart you can see that A measures 1 2 3 4 pattern while B covers 5 6 steps of the sequence A B on the left January run is self explanatory the fractals are measured as they are A B on the right current price action formation is where we need some math to get involved particularly when we are working with the new B movement prediction And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance Again the main fractal property re occurrence will play on our side Predicting the price movements on a volatile market like this one is one of the most ungrateful things to do so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you apesters My theory is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move using data from previous one And here we only need the coefficient from first A B move A simple ratio dividing first B move about $325 increase by first A move $131 gives us a coefficient of about 2 48 Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height about $330 based on my prediction which is built later in this post which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818 landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week Boom looks beautiful and promising Fractals baby I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far smoothie brainie But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed Particularly it is the the sequence part number 4 where the price action stands currently And yeah you guessed it almighty fractals are helping us here again Below you will find two charts both are 30 min charts which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why GME price action 22 27 January GME price action 5 15 March Because they look similar again Now I will ask you to excuse me I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago and I really need to get some sleep as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left so this explanation will be brief I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs Remember being in the market at those moments Wooh that was fun And finally take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow not only it averages the price action it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action $380 ish That's it folks mic drop TL DR Fractals is life fractals is love ❤️ as is GEEEMEEE,2021-03-15 07:15:12,"1. {""GME"":

short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill gotten gain When it is time to drive the stock price down a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers The playbook is very similar from attack to attack and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well Typical tactics include the following Flooding the offer side of the board Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply offer and demand bid for the shares find equilibrium This equation happens every day for every stock traded On days when more people want to buy than want to sell the price goes up and conversely when shares offered for sale exceed the demand the price goes down The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares They will do what has been called a short down ladder It works as follows Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10 Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position Short B will then offer a short counterfeit share at $9 Short A will hit that offer or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid Short A buys the share for $9 covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral If there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic fails to deliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will mask the extraordinary high volume It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares An off shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access The trader's performance was tallied and based upon the number of shares moved and the other success parameters the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily At the end of each day the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe Instant gratification Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry By early 2005 their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent At that point an investor Robert Simpson purchased 100 of Global Links' 1 158 064 issued and outstanding shares He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC disclosing he owned all of the company's stock His total investment was $5205 The share price was $ 00434 The day after he acquired all of the company's shares the volume on the over the counter market was 37 million shares The following day saw 22 million shares change hands all without Simpson trading a single share It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation but that would be difficult without the company's involvement It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume This is called crashing the stock and a successful crash is a one day drop of twenty percent or a thirty five percent drop in a week In order to make the crash stick or make it more effective it is done concurrently with all or most of the following Media Assault The shorts in order to realize their profit must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media The shorts have friendly reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency the Wall Street Journal Barrons the New York Times Gannett Publications USA Today and the Arizona Republic CNBC and others The common thread A number of the friendly reporters worked for The Street com an Internet advisory service that short hedge fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted libelous innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company as it was being crashed One of the more outrageous stories was a front page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005 The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times This mistake was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story The explanation Due to a mathematical error appeared three days later after the damage was done to the stock price Jim Cramer in a video taped interview with The Street com best described the media function When shorting The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view so the hedge funds create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders a short down ladder that pushes the price down then we go to the press You have a vicious cycle down it's a pretty good game This interview which is more like a confession was never supposed to get on the air however it somehow ended up on YouTube Cramer and The Street com have made repeated efforts with some success to get it taken off of YouTube Pulling margin from long customers The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy This causes a flood of margin selling which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover Paid bashers The shorts will hire paid bashers who invade the message boards of the company The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics Analyst Reports Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports The reports which were represented as being independent were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned friendly media All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation Planting moles in target companies The shorts plant moles inside target companies The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors They steal confidential information which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media The information may not be true may be out of context or the stolen documents may be altered Things that are supposed to be confidential like SEC preliminary inquiries end up as front page news with the short friendly media Frivolous SEC investigations The shorts leak tips to the SEC about corporate malfeasance by the target company The SEC which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests swoops in as the supposed confidential inquiry is leaked to the short media The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings Occasionally they do uncover an Enron but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty five percent The announcement of no or little findings comes months later but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community Class Action lawsuits Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes a handful of law firms immediately file class action shareholder suits Milberg Weiss before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation could be counted on to file a class action suit against a company that was under short attack Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media again causing panic among small investors Interfering with target company's customers financings etc If the shorts became aware of clients customers or financings that the target company was working on they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product Disclaimer This is not financial advice this is not my work I'm just copy/pasting the article bolding the most

This is going to be the first post of 5 regarding crispr and why it's the play of the decade 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Mods thank you so much for letting me post it If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any edits no pun intended The next post will be about their current drug pipeline This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10 k's licensing agreements court filings and a lot of adderall Intro What is crispr Crispr stands for c lustered r egularly i nterspaced s hort p alindromic r epeats It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes Why should I care Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century and received a Nobel for its discovery last year It's not an understatement that in the next coming years crispr will impact just about every part of our lives It's not just me saying this Bill Gates poured in $100M and momma Cathie believe that this is one of the most revolutionary things of this century Joe Davis of Vanguard found the idea multiplier to be similar to how the internet took off If you cannot see this can change the world crispr could help by eliminating that extra chromosome you probably have Editas $EDIT Editas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders in vivo and for various forms of cancer ex vivo Their business model is actually pretty smart They're targeting rare diseases for drug development and licensing out the IP for crispr Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable and easier to develop You essentially can monopolize a disease and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up The IP though is going to be the breadwinner Essentially any drug developed with crispr will give an 8 13 royalty to $EDIT Not to get too technical but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary and far exceeds anything else on the market They estimate they can target about 95 of the human genome One drug of note in their pipeline that is of interest is EDIT 201 EDIT 201 is essentially engineered T cells with CARs and Engineered TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells This is an interesting treatment solid forms of cancer This could potentially be an alternative or complementary to chemotherapy The collaboration is with Juno Therapeutics acquired by BMY who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources Others include sickle cell usher syndrome and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials The patent $EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement But there is a consensus slowly forming that $EDIT will acquire the patent The winner for the patent will easily make billions off of the IP If Broad wins the patent it is the responsibility of EDIT to develop drugs based off of crispr and license the patent to other companies which $EDIT would collect a royalty of $EDIT is then set to pay a royalty from that revenue to the Broad Institute $EDIT already has licensing agreements in place with Juno Therapeutics $BMY and $BEAM therapeutics page 31 32 The catalysts Biotech has a lot of catalysts It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon In the short term there's drug trials A notable YOLO came from one of our very own with just shares where he turned $12k into $322k in a week Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT 301 trial and then put out a press release which caused the stock to go from $33 $99 the following weeks This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares or LEAPs are the safest choice The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials Positions 100 $23 56 10 $50c 4/16 1 $53c 4/16 20 $60c 4/16 I am long on shares and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday Disclaimer I have a degree in molecular bio and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market TL DR One of the most disruptive things ever only has a

My first DD: I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshot,1330,n70cim,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/,813,1620428020.0,My first DD I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshot First of all this is all just my speculation and not financial advice I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months I am not a financial advisor or professional What I am is a physician with at least some literacy though not expertise in oncology In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training Without further ado I present my first DD I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had MD in it so it caught my attention but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC epic is the 1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar and anyone asking that probably 1 is actually a doctor and 2 doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician not much unlike the famous Dr Burry That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to do my own DD as they say Now I am not 100 sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well ok just a little well right Background I open the patent application and read up on it My first impression Lol you can't treat GBM For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer read more here that is one of the few death sentences that exist in medicine I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much Patients die within a year basically 100 of the time even with advances such as gamma knife radiation I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable But then I read more about their tech and the patent and wait a second this actually sounds legit So now to break down some of the science behind this Methods INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes To put it in non doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment due to what is called the blood brain barrier Your brain is reasonably so walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either In particular the medicine they have developed INO 5401 is a PD 1 inhibitor but delivered into the brain As soon as I saw PD 1 this peaked my interest hard anti PD 1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that uncloak cancer from hiding from your immune system The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab read more here which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug That's where INO comes in with their patented tech Results Go to the patent link above and click images This is the money shot MRI on left v bad cancer MRI on the right cancer is dead What Yep Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution Mind blowing Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD 1 inhibitors is varied Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away but only in some patients I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously Google her Conclusion Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money I go look up the study This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective phase 1 is the drug safe phase 2 does the drug work did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies I saunter over to clinical trials gov the federal website where all clinical trials are listed and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021 The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol meaning they have 99 of their data and the study is essentially complete I then saunter over to google com the worlds largest search engine and look for other data they have Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA Overall survival and Progression free survival are the holy grails of results in cancer research The fact that they have 80 progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent But again how is it that this is gonna moon soon Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences Dates May 12 May 18 Not just a one tiered moon shot but a two tiered moon shot Discussion In conclusion their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings I don't know what I'm more excited about a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon I like the stock I like the tech I like the implications to cancer treatment Disclosures No affiliation with any of the above companies I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning I have no idea what I'm doing In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know ,2021-05-08 01:53:40,"3. {""INO"": ""Rise""}"

most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink which will provide FIXED POINT broadband to customers albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality They value is at $40bn This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS by way of comparison So there is a there there in terms of what we are playing for here Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO the real market is and always will be in

solution your existing handset x200B Haha let's get back to business read on $ASTS AST Spacemobile has re imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE x200B 1 Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites This allows the satellite to do the work not the phone 2 By innovating with software $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect importantly ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications Here is the overview of the FACTS PRODUCT • ASTS is building the first of a kind and only space based cellular broadband network that is direct to device a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices • The constellation utilizes low and mid band frequencies shared with partners on a non interference basis ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use • ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks • The service will eliminate coverage gaps is compatible with all phones provides broadband data speeds and is accessible via one click on a user’s device MARKET • ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure e g towers is less developed • ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends i falling launch costs ii high smartphone penetration iii broadband demand iv 5G IoT proliferation • ASTS cites 3 3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected • Key regional opportunities include India Africa and Equatorial regions • The service is well suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back up during natural disasters MANAGEMENT • CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications sold for $550MM in 2016 • The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK Globecomm NASA and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers 34 of whom are PhDs COMPETITION • ASTS competes with high cost legacy providers including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect • ASTS also competes with the build out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial financial and technical milestones OTHER Investors include Vodafone Rakuten American Tower and Samsung all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS The dogs are eating the dog food TIMELINE • April 2019 – BW 1 was launched the test satellite validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system • 2H 2021E will launch BW3 which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024 ANALYSIS THIS IS MY OPINION AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT • ASTS is an exciting event driven story stock with open ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs significant industry backing and bone fide strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business • Management funded the seed capital for the business highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’ • Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘ big idea ’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets • The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU • The investment set up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully fund the project and remove financing risk • With 1 year lock ups on existing investors and PIPE investors there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing • Given future CAPEX Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company RISKS • While the BlueWalker satellite provided proof of concept there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed • Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service reducing appeal for full tower placement • Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution • ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk INVESTMENT CHECKLIST Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment BUSINESS MODEL ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT T given its large fixed cost base the Company expects to generate 90 asset level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow GO TO MARKET In place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to 1 3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers or directly bear the cost of churn • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1 6BN people subsequent phases expand into Europe and N America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024 DEFENSIBILITY ASTS has 750 patents as well as a first mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market CAPITAL ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation TRACTION ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction however it is yet unclear what end user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the Bluewalker 1 test satellite FINANCIALS With a market cap of $1 8bn the company is expected to generate $1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched 27MM total subscribers with an ARPU of $2 50 per user Below are projections x200B When thinking about a hypothetical valuation I pro forma the numbers and apply a multiple in line with the tower companies I treat depreciation as a real cash expense x200B TECHNOLOGY DETAILS OVERVIEW AST Science “ASTS” has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct to device’ service to normal phones BOOMBOX IN SPACE ASTS’ satellites are 10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell phone towers in space With a 900 square meter array the system is a large “loud” system that can connect with a regular mobile phone Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones SOFTWARE ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks The “magic” of the technology is the back end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum seamlessly interconnect over existing networks and talk directly to an LTE system ASTS is 6G forward compatible BACKHAUL Once the signal is collected from a handset ASTS sends the data back on B Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system The phone satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum CAPACITY Each satellite can handle 1 2MM GB per month extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area WHAT DO WE KNOW What has ASTS done to prove its system o Bluewalker1 proved the RF could close e g the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost effectively check an important element of technical diligence Bluewalker1 allowed for end to end connectivity testing which has been reviewed over the last 1 5 years o Bluewalker3 2H 2021 launch will be a scaled version of the system which will de risk components and demonstrate the full technology BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system RISKS Most of the risks are timing risks For instance Bluewalker3 could spur the need to tune microns which could delay the system deployment by months The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days BENT PIPE The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky most of the design relates to distributing power The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing DISCLOSURE I own 500 401 shares of common Yes this is a huge position You only live once invest carefully and with great vision To avoid accusations of being a shill below is proof of my position I'm grateful for the moderators working with me so that I can meet the requirements to post I have a new appreciation

The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,4403,mk5h3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk5h3m/the_us_govt_has_a_huge_incentive_to_massively/,803,1617601008.0,The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation TL DR The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation A 1 underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades For background the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS calculates inflation It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index or CPI The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number 1 Many government revenues and expenditures are inflation linked either directly or indirectly Directly linked 1 Social security payments Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI W very similar to the CPI 2 Every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth $37 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by $370 billion 2 Tax brackets Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation 3 This means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues 3 Treasury Inflation Protected Securities These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation They are linked to the CPI These securities known as TIPS compromise 8 of the US federal debt 4 This is $2 24 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by $22 billion There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt Indirectly linked 1 Debt interest payments Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation The US government has $26 trillion in Treasury debt The yearly cost of servicing this debt is 1 2 of that roughly $378 billion in 2020 If investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by $260 billion for every 1 increase in expected inflation There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones I could find When we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just 1 can save the government between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year This is 30 of the entire tax revenue of the US government Underreporting inflation by 3 4 a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year Evidence of underreporting There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation 1 Changes to the CPI formula Originally the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods In this case the CPI was a cost of goods index COGI However over time the U S Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living 1﻿ Consequently the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index COLI Over the years the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions According to the BLS the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution Substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket ﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI However critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U S government to report a lower CPI 5 Essentially the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported When a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this When the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another lower priced good is substituted for it 2 Rent In 2005 the average US rent was $755 In 2019 it was $1 164 6 This is an increase of 54 or an average yearly increase of 3 1 During the same time the CPI has gone from 191 6 to 252 4 7 which is only a 31 increase or an average yearly increase of 1 9 If we use rent as the true measure of inflation CPI has underreported inflation by 1 1 per year Keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the 2007 2008 crisis The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 8 Nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI What do you think Is the US government massively underreporting inflation ,2021-04-05 08:36:48,"4. {""NULL""}"

The Greatest Market Bubble of All Time. A Full Bear Counter-Thesis.,2003,lpdni5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpdni5/the_greatest_market_bubble_of_all_time_a_full/,791,1613992156.0,The Greatest Market Bubble of All Time A Full Bear Counter Thesis x200B The more things change the more they stay the same There is nothing new under the sun x200B In every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments These people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history Let's address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis x200B 1 Interest rates are low Nowhere for money to go except stocks When you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic It's essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable In other words it's a manifestation of the greedy FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles Ultimately these bull aren't even arguing that we aren't in a bubble They are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED The obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low interest rate environment What's the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio I lose 2 per year Not good of course but not the end of the world either What's the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes I lose 50 of my funds in as little as a month Ouch The idea that I'm forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2 a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset Of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won't crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls They see a dip and they buy it They see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more And before they realize the dip isn't simply a dip they are already fucked Tale as old as time The funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational Why hold cash when bonds pay more Why buy bonds when index funds pay more Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more After all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify What's most interesting is that this argument isn't even new The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even WSB is well aware of 2 If you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right This is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to perma bears then you would have missed out on massive gains And therefore the implicit argument is you can NEVER sit out If you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme It's Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory I have to stay in the market perpetually I can never sit out because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy First of all I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma bears People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma bears There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed An intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear They adapt to the market And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma bear The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out x200B Let's take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history x200B Major Indicators of the Great Bubble x200B 1 MASSIVE retail investment Worldwide What are some signs of bubbles historically Well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market Do we have that today CHECK on fucking steroids We've got people who can't change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin Like WTF The 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday do they even have dishes I don't fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit Are you kidding me Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching Not to mention the entire short squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck Past US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1 300 PE ratio What's that noise Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance The Max Pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors This is of course bullshit but it's food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo 2 Ridiculously speculative investments AKA SPACs CCIV is worth 15 billion dollars And it owns literally nothing No deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the SPAC has no earnings or revenue to speak of just 15 billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium I can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed What is a SPAC at the end of the day A rich guy steps up and says give me your money and I'll decide what I'll do with it in a few months And a million retards step up and say SOUNDS GREAT TAKE MY MONEY Tell me this SPAC shit isn't exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing There is no way this SPAC mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end 3 Options volume absolutely exploding Options are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors AKA gamblers in the current market Stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market But what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term I just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker The question I sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume You know like derivative CDO's leveraging worthless mortgages back in 2008 It's something to think about I'll just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me This is neither natural nor sustainable 4 Greater Fool logic I'll just quote investopedia since I'm getting lazy here The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date This is because there will always be someone i e a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality If the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another “greater fool ” who could also be hoping to flip them quickly Unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions In 2008 when investors purchased faulty mortgage backed securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed Basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy Nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value This is talking about you 5 Buffet Indicator through the roof The Buffet Indicator has reach it's highest ever level For noobies who don't know what this means the Buffett Indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom There are two arguments against the Buffett Indicator as a useful metric The first argument is that GDP is a backward indicator and therefore doesn't account for future growth While this is true it misses the entire point The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles The point is to tie market valuations to some real world metric which is necessarily backward looking The other argument against the Buffett Indicator which holds more weight is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren't adequately represented by US GDP I will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and can't simply be discarded 6 Valuations divorced from reality During every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company Back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes That is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website This internet thing was a New Paradigm and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were Needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight Take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation I like to pick on Tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun 7 Fed Manipulation Most bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates This market is no different They create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on It's like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house The catch is interest rates can't drop below zero I mean they can But who wants to be Japan for the rest of history Alright I've written enough already and I won't write a whole thesis on Fed action and its consequences for now global markets I'll just leave this pic here TL DR SHIT IS FUCKED SON Play the game of chicken as long as you want but at the end

forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19 66/share This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value in the $BILLIONS but are harder to assess Again it’s trading at $10 62 as of this writing a price/tangible book value of only 0 54 Value investors typically look for stocks trading at 3 0 price/TBV Deep value would be 1 0 KT is trading at 0 54 and a price/book ratio of 0 42 Shares are cheap options are cheap Do what you will – hell sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls KT CORPORATE PROFILE KT Corporation formerly Korea Telecom is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia Africa USA Poland KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete Line of Business of Korean Market Share Mobile Services 31 4 Fixed line local telephone VoIP 64 9 Broadband Internet Access 40 9 Pay TV Services 31 6 As a conglomerate KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots Products Services of Total Revenue Mobile Services incl 5G 27 3 Fixed line incl VoIP broadband data comm 19 5 Media Content 10 1 Financial Services incl credit card solutions 14 6 Other incl IT network services real estate development 11 6 Sale of goods primarily mobile handsets 16 8 Corporate Location Map KT has 30 institutional ownership with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020 KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program For what it’s worth in this day and age the short of shares outstanding is a measly 0 09 No one is going short on this thing at its current price You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller FINANCIAL METRICS PEER COMPARISONS KT’s balance sheet is rock solid While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis it is still growing and maybe more importantly doing so profitably I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above but this cannot be understated If you were to liquidate the company entirely shareholders would receive $20 30 per share after the debt had been repaid I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT Compared to US based telecom services index peers Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26 33 $109 88 unrealistic top end Compared to industry peers/comps The following comparison is really the tale of the tape When we look at tangible book value we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value This is obvious given the share price should exceed the liquidation value But we see the opposite being true for KT Again it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares liquidate the company and double your money This is what I mean by real deep fucking value Not that we put much weight in them around here but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well with median upside of 33 They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls Everyone looks for the TLDR at the bottom I put it at the top of the post but here it is Massively undervalued $30/share realistic price target it's trading at half of its tangible book value meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares liquidate the company's tangible assets pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets This is REAL value ,2021-02-11 06:13:49,14.

Aphria Inc (APHA): my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀,1455,lgj8fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgj8fp/aphria_inc_apha_my_final_post_before_merger/,747,1612950945.0,Aphria Inc APHA my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀 Hello some of you might know me from my initial post before new year and my follow up post two weeks later I suggest you guys read those first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger I won't post again before merger because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price Next post will be about gains after merger Introduction another look back Well well well I have to take you guys back to the beginning After a long time lurking the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit What a journey that has been I have to remind you guys that before this post by u/WatAb0utB0b after they acquired Sweetwater basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria Then I made my post after the merger announcement still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at again a shout out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow up post some people finally took notice although still not a lot And here we are right at this very moment the entire subreddit is currently talking about it I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich There's no denying it Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels I told you guys before once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks This is exactly what happened Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now There might be minor political obstructions but there's no stopping the general movement Once the American legalization movement is done it will probably also influence European regulators Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point If it isn't already let me give you another couple of reasons why It's not about the joints it's about the CBD oil Let's be honest to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image CBD motherfucking oil I would even say it has a very positive image Most people probably think about it like this joints junkees in the park getting high CBD oil people suffering from cancer relieving their pain Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted that doesn't change the general consensus about the product You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people People will be buying drinks food even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana EU mostly Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025 Markets are fucking insane right now cannabis mania 2 0 is inevitable I don't have to tell you guys about it This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again except this time there is actually nothing holding it back The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018 There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment so I quote old pal George Soros The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people Green energy EV cannabis all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around can you guys believe it The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment Praise the lord Amen Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage TLRYtards are missing out There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria There I said it I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post but here is a small summary Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray Aphria will get a 62 stake in new Tilray old Tilray will get a 38 stake To account for this split Aphria owners will receive 0 8381 shares for each APHA share they own Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0 8381 The only risks are 1 the merger doesn't go through or 2 the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0 67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0 57 at this moment I've seen other people post about this but they are missing something As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0 8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore All you have to do is compare YOUR buy in price with the Tilray price As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0 8381 you will profit from the merger It's as simple as that TLDR Cannabis arguably best growth market for the near future or long term Aphria best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement free tendies no reason to pick Tilray This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price Positions I still have my measily 30 shares $8 74 that I've been holding since the start of December If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in I will probably buy more

Value OSTK is undervalued At first glance one may wonder does a stock with a 4000 run from its 52 week low and up 54 YTD have room to grow Point 1 There has not been broader market interest in this stock in over a year Put simply demand for shares as examined through volume traded at 1D 1M 1 quarter as well as 1 year averages is at a low Fig 1 OSTK overview Point 2 OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1 1x sales The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair W Fig 2 OSTK and W relative comparisons Point 3 Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing 1 month ago institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40 through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley Allianz SE Blackrock and Vanguard as well In fact Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year Last week Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7 5 Fig 3 Bloomie institutional data Fig 4 Bloomie institutional breakdown Point 4 OSTK has short interest of over 10 With 42 77 million shares outstanding and a 40 million share float latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4 374 million shares are currently held short While that may seem relatively small naked short selling is still occurring with 16 SEC fail to delivers during January occurring on OSTK 20210104 690370101

posts on Twitter Point 5 OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker dealer issues cough Robinhood cough and transparency at the right time Briefly tZero is an alternative trading system regulated by the SEC that will enable people to invest in any asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto tokenized securities and

the platform by Q4 2021 Fig 5 tZERO trading volume Fig 6 tZERO $ nominal trading volume Point 5 OSTK holds a 90 stake in tZERO tZERO is nascent With only $53 million traded in digital token securities this is small to other markets and exchanges However this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020 Numbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year to year traded Coinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion In 2020 it had a revenue of $2 3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks Napkin math simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities $53 million in digital tokens $13 million in c$rypto $67 million this implies tZero has a valuation of $2 5 billion when compared to Coinbase Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value Fig 7 Coinbase revenue DYOR Know your risk Size appropriately Manage your own trade Important areas to watch next 130 172 256 394 482 512 tl dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK's true value On a simple relative valuation OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same

For the smoothbrains that means CRSR is about to go 🚀🚀,2455,lhywc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhywc2/govment_just_announced_theyre_stepping_in_to/,697,1613117692.0,Govment just announced they're stepping in to resolve the semi conductor shortage CRSR held down by shorts For the smoothbrains that means CRSR is about to go 🚀🚀 I've been posting my retarded YOLO play on CRSR Position 100 x 3/19 70C 500 shares avg $39 5 Am I really eating crayons Yes I butt chugged a 60 pack of Crayola this morning so DYOR and decide for yourself First and only thing you really need to know is RGB buy But since this sub has been infiltrated by FUD filled paper handed wrinklebrain bears heres why I am on my way to the moon and it’s not too late for you RECAP Breif history of CRSR the stock blew up post IPO from $17 riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36 The float is low so swings are volatile Also lots of short volume bla bla 1/13 a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze maybe retail and/or institutional Citadel is 2 owner of CRSR float or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters who knows Cool so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap It starts climbing back to the average peak levels then 1/27 CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7 5 million shares it hits a high of $49 before a 2 day selloff Crash Boogaloo After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report with expectations of excellent numbers IV is through the roof Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable 2/9 CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report EPS beats estimates $1 7B revenue for the year profit margins way up debt is down and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages which every other tech company is dealing with too After this amazing ER the stock tops out at about $48 premarket before nosediving nearly hitting $40 Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest But looking at what actually happned it wasn't actually just hype The pre ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021 so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush sell limits were triggered self fulfilling prophecy So the price starts to fall into oversold territory Quote from Barron's Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy and one has a Hold rating on the name Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9 But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to Neutral from Buy causing the selloff to dip even lower hitting just above $40 Their justification They think gaming demand could wane in 2021 and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100 of demand due to shortages of chimps ha CURRENT SITUATION That brings us to today CRSR is way oversold $1 7B profitable revenue yet $3 9B market cap for a fast growth tech company pitiful Almost every analyst including Goldman has increased their price targets many above $50 Compare that to LOGI $2 9B revenue $4 4B TTM at $19 9B market cap and climbing fast Speaking of LOGI check out this chart 1/19 Post Earnings dip before running to ATH 2 weeks later But CRSR price is still down why my neuro atypical friends Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50 every day Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon But pressure is easing as of 1/29 short interest dropped 44 from the previous report And daily short volume dipped below 50 yesterday for the first time in months this isn't a squeeze play this means that short downward pressure is backing off IVs starting to return to earth And what also happened today The P OTUS just announced by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases We all know new players get hooked and there are tens of millions of them since last year The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market which 1000 isn't going away Without the shortages there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals this is a $65 $70 stock EASY You will not beat this entry point Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least TL DR RGB Buy Get on the 🚀 You’ll thank me in a month Or don’t listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast DYOR Clarification for all the recently acquired WSB dipshits confused how a stock could be good without 200 short interest and near bankruptcy fundamentals this isn't a squeeze play short pressure is backing off because they know it has actual legs ,2021-02-12 10:14:52,5.

hand.",8101,maxt80,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maxt80/gme_poker_cannibalism_and_why_the_apes_are_going/,696,1616475516.0,GME Poker cannibalism and why the apes are going to win this hand I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice Listen up apes I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it Now I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal or really anything with meaningful content so let's just talk about card games How do casinos make money on poker For each hand of poker played the casino takes a small percentage of the pot which is called the rake The casino provides the establishment and the dealers the players play and the casino takes its commission Okay great but what the fuck does this have to do with GME We're getting there Hang on The edging is real but you'll get your payoff So the casino takes its cut from each pot The more money in the pot the more money the casino makes Great How do they maximize profits Well they can bring in more players get players to play longer deal more hands per hour and/or increase the average size of the pots I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these because it doesn't matter What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money you just need to understand their business model Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots There are tons of ways to do this but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino you're at a local back alley gambling spot Their operation isn't super sophisticated They just install a few of their cronys into each game Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals bring people in loosen up the tables and create big pots As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table and lose it the house will profit There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money right Well that's not entirely true In fact it's not at all true Then why the fuck did I mention it Well you tell me why the fuck would you play a rigged game Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth they will still play Not all of them but a lot of them In fact it's even a good thing for the house when dumb money make money this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently The house wants you to play The house wants your friends to play The house wants everyone to play So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play Did you fucking read the last paragraph It's simple you make it the best way for anyone to make money You essentially force them to play Don't get lost in the details It doesn't matter how this is accomplished They can lick you suck you fuck you beat you squeeze you whack the other competition off etc All that matters is that whatever game they run it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery So what happens when players make too much money I don't know what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code What happens when the sheep start misbehaving A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame Again the game is rigged and the minions have one fucking job follow the script and don't get too greedy Any problem and I mean any problem is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood Reddit is an enormous echo chamber Shit gets loud in here but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big they're not going to care They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery So what the hell am I actually saying about GME The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some Epsteins but as long as the apes don't fold the apes win this round If the mobsters play this game right they'll fold this hand take their losses and as usual end up winning in the long run They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff This is EZ mode Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family a bigly minion or even the fucking godfather You live by the sword you die by the sword When you have an infected limb you first try to treat it but if that doesn't work you cut that shit off These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own I'm sure that some of them even prefer it The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder and the cannibals are going to feast TL DR Read the fucking post It took me way longer to write than it will take most of you to read it Here's some 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌🏻 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 since half of you autists need

urgent RE EDUCATION unify clarify focus and execute How can I start this the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification if we are to steer this thing back onto the road Whether we want to admit it or not we're fucking drifting atm The hype is dying as all hypes do the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability we're all poor so we don't care it's either moon or bankruptcy TH THA THA TH time out Listen up fucktards I'm poor too but that's not the point We need to go over the whole situation with perspective and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells Repeat after me we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this We are not triggering shit so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to Picture a roman colosseum an old stadium you mongs In the middle of the arena down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing having a jolly good time There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit so that's done They're already there shorting GME to shit not by 13 which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008 but by a staggering 50 to 130 numbers irrelevant point is the ammo is more than enough As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit so they're confident and comfortable Now for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things a boogeyman something blocking the goddamn exit The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all meaning THE END It could be literally a thousand different things and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company Ryan Cohen for example earnings blowing out anything And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment and it will soon show THEN we come We the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it What are we We are bodies Pilling up On the fucking exits The more shares you own the fatter you are and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit And my friend my friend the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership buyers that won't sell no matter what then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen Sure there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions but likely not nearly enough That's our part If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares that would be nearly 20 million shares That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available If say over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person half of WSB would own a staggering 60 of all the shares and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands some even millions Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot Heck even I with my 20 shares god bless them can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing Time really is on our side if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover GME goes straight to the MOON We don't need to worry at all there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed We need to unify clarify focus and execute x200B TLDR The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now Hype will kill this because hype dies We need to clarify our role and execute with patience We don't trigger short squeezes our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock or most of it they panic and GME moons Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can and to understand your role This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be x200B Obviously this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways

Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview,18009,lfyzh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfyzh5/cramer_is_working_hard_to_take_down_videos_of_his/,687,1612892354.0,Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview Plenty of you degenerates have seen the interview from 2006 where Jim Cramer talks about about stock manipulation being a fun game from his hedge fund days He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough to go after hedge funds for fomenting or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics What does that tell you about how wide spread this is in the industry Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful Because the truth is so against your view that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction And um the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down Everyone have a good hard think about this This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market He's allowed to continue without consequence yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago Can confirm he is a prick EDIT Here is a transcript of first 2 minutes 40 seconds of the interview if you can't watch the video in comments It goes on for another 8 but this should be enough for your ape attention spans A Welcome to Wallstreet Confidential I'm Aaron Tass joined again by Jim Cramer Jim Welcome Cramer Good to see ya A Thanks for being here Uh so economic data out today but wanna talk about something else first Again today we have the misdirection from the futures The futures pointing up in market as of right now it's actually down again Is this just because it's the holiday period that we're seeing this Cramer You know a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was position short meaning I needed it down I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures It doesn't take much money Similarly or if I were long and wanted to make things a little bit rosy I would go and take a bunch of stocks and make sure they were higher Maybe commit 5 million in capital to do it and I could effect it What you're seeing now is probably a bigger market maybe you need 10 million to knock the stuff down But it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game You can move it up and then fade it that often creates a very negative feel So let's say you take a longer term view intra day and you say listen I'm gonna boost the futures and when the real sellers comes in I'm gonna knock it down and it's gonna create a negative view That's a strategy very worth doing When you're valuing on a day to day basis I would encourage anyone who's in a hedge fund to do it because it's legal And it uh is a very quick way to make money And very satisfying And by the way no one else in the world would ever admit that but I don't care And I can't I'm not gonna say it on TV A There's so many more hedge funds today than when you were managing yours Do you think that exacerbates the moves or makes it tougher Cramer Well you know the hedge funds are positioned long short They're not just long like mutual funds So it's really vital these next 6 days cuz of your pay day you really gotta control the market You can't let it lift When you've got research in motion it's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down because it's the fulcrum of the market today So let's say I were short what I would do is I would hit a lot of guys with RIM now you can't foment That's a violation of of A Ferment lol Cramer Yeah you can't FOment You can't create yourself an impression that a stock's down But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it So I mean that's the only sense I would say this is illegal But a hedge fund not up a lot really has to do a lot to save itself So this is different from what I was talking about in the beginning where I'd be buying the Q's and stuff This is actually just blatantly illegal But when you have 6 days and your company may be in doubt because you're down I think it's really important to foment if I were one of these guys x200B x200B ,2021-02-09 19:39:14,"3. {""NULL""}"

DON'T SELL AT A LOSS. (some advice on fundamentals for new traders),5755,lt7miq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt7miq/dont_sell_at_a_loss_some_advice_on_fundamentals/,685,1614401801.0,DON'T SELL AT A LOSS some advice on fundamentals for new traders 💎🙌🦍here I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper handing Paper handing is fundamentally bad investment practice especially if you're a new investor I'll explain why DISLAIMER I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet So take it for what it’s worth But based on all the fact that paper handing is even an issue here you apes clearly need this advice EDIT These are fundamentals to the way I trade but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing which doesn't encourage YOLO ing This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to outsmart the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it There are other approaches which often require more experience but I feel this is most accessible to new investors GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything Well everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted New traders or people who are thinking of becoming new traders should read this Especially if you're new I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market This applies to all stock not just GME If you're experienced it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 2 4 but since a friend of a friend told me he paper handed on GME sold the dip I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea I would encourage people to buy GME but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while edit in addition just to reiterate keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down By this I mean NEVER SELL AT A LOSS Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down All newbie investors IMO should adhere to this rule just in general Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground or don’t buy it at all Many investors myself included follow this rule religiously not just with GME but with all stocks I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss I just held or bought more COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out I just held and was fine should have bought more If everyone bought into GME with this mindset I bet it would go to Pluto easily If you sell at a loss you are donating to the save the short sellers fund out of your own wallet fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes and you’re not even following sound investment practice Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red just don’t Emotion and the stock market do not mix well Stop losses below purchase price are also for pansies and genuine idiots “I’ll sell you some stock but only if you give me a bad enough price on it ” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down if you feel like you need a stop loss you're investing more than you should Instead of being stupid maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips Side note personally in the case of GME I don’t have any limit sells either From what I can tell on past short squeezes the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket you should have plenty of time Set price alerts and relax No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid launch Although if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it As far as I know buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs it drives the price up just not as much as buying and holding But personally my philosophy is I can take baby profits anytime who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again So I’m holding 101 shares at cost average $106/share Want to get into the game now You could always just buy a few shares and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more bringing your cost average down Ideally you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero Always try to keep cash in reserve Locked yourself in at a high price That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down Didn't keep any cash in reserve Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things 1 the short squeeze which will likely though not certainly happen 2 for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases or 3 you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS and you will never lose edit well seldom if ever Unless the company goes bankrupt a rare occurrence This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero it won't swallow your portfolio Also if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson Hedge funds and billionaires know this that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic They bought the dip while regular folks paper handed and got even poorer One more little trick If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares then even if your position goes “underwater ” you can always sell covered calls at above your average cost bring DOWN your cost basis and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss Make sure they are covered i e you hold onto the actual stock for the duration of the call otherwise it’s extremely risky Although if you sold even a covered call right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen and you'll need to be patient and like I said before say goodbye to your money for a while EDIT Just to reiterate there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies Trade however you want just don’t paper hand GME I would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price It still follows the rule of don't sell at a loss Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100 doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier You can even slowly take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5 and sell one when it goes up 5 EDIT Yes I know about opportunity cost It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom In an ideal world you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities Yes I know about and agree with the sunk cost fallacy My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal lowering the cost basis not “doubling down” on sunk cost Tl dr 🦍buy 🍌 don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌 Not financial advice I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped

Options Greeks and why GME far OTM calls are counter productive,4601,lyu9n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyu9n0/options_greeks_and_why_gme_far_otm_calls_are/,679,1615034811.0,Options Greeks and why GME far OTM calls are counter productive I got asked to write this post to explain my opinion on GME's option trading and why I think buying far OTM C800 etc is actually bad for everyone trying to watch the price rise Before we get into any real discussion standard legal shit I'm not a financial advisor I'm not a pro This is my opinion and not advice My position I'm basically completely bled dry so I only hold one 3/19 C300 and yes I know it's a long shot but I'm deep into other positions I got the call because I begrudgingly love this sub and the autists that frequent it Okay so people want to buy FD's and get paid but it's important to understand what you're actually doing when you buy that option and pay that premium I am hoping that I won't be downvoted to oblivion because I'm actually trying to help people understand as much as I can and be more successful I'm not an expert so this is my best understanding of how options work x200B Let's talk about options Strike Price A strike price is the set price at which a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it is exercised For call options the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder for put options the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold the strike price is what everyone screams about and it's the magic numbers we want to watch the price go to in order to ensure our options are In The Money ITM If options are ITM that means that your option has value even if it doesn't go past the point where you hit a break even which ideally you want to see to realize a profit All option contracts that are ITM are subject to potential exercise and this is where the magic happens Options that expire OTM are worthless All those 3/5 C800 yes all 30 000 of them that expired Free money to the people that sold them to you Why did you give free money to the people that are going to spend it to try to stop you from making more money Well probably because you didn't understand what you were doing x200B Premium This is the money you paid to the option seller The hedge fund the market maker the theta Chad trying to fuck your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend You need to keep in mind that this money goes directly into their pocket and they don't just put it away for a rainy day They may do shit with that money to increase their chances of being correct and your chance of being out of the money OTM x200B Delta Delta is the ratio that compares the change in the price of an asset usually marketable securities to the corresponding change in the price of its derivative For example if a stock option has a delta value of 0 65 this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share the option on it will rise by $0 65 per share all else being equal At The Money options typically have Deltas hanging around 5 $ 50 per $1 of underlying price movement where as far OTM calls have extremely low Delta because they're still extremely unlikely to expire ITM Options that are ITM already have Delta's around 1 $1 for every $1 of underlying price movement because every gain is seen as a profit because you're already past the point of probability x200B Gamma Gamma is the rate of change in an option's delta per 1 point move in the underlying asset's price Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a derivative's value in relation to the underlying A delta hedge strategy seeks to reduce gamma in order to maintain a hedge over a wider price range A consequence of reducing gamma however is that alpha will also be reduced x200B Gamma incorporates time Gamma will be low and look much like a bell curve with respect to time When time decreases the price of the option is extremely sensitive to time because you have less time to see your option change in value ITM options become increasingly more likely to expire ITM and OTM options become increasingly less valuable because it would take a fucking miracle to make them ITM x200B Let's talk about orders and price movement a little What makes selling an option safe What makes it risky Ask yourself a simple question if you want to be successful are you move likely to sell an OTM call at C50 or C500 Obviously you're more likely to not get assigned your call exercise if your strike price is higher How can you understand the risk A few key concepts x200B Volume Knowing how much buying and selling happens on a regular basis can inform your intuition as to how much volatility you might expect If you see a stock with a volume of 1M you might assume from that the chance of volume of 100M is very low x200B Holding Holding your shares of your stock does a few things when we consider basic economics It lowers the supply of the desired underlying It may not have any effect at all on the demand Smart people will look at a 'cult' of people holding and understand that this is a 'control' or a constant rather than a variable on which they can incorporate to make decisions If you know people won't sell suddenly and that if you can presume that they have no more buying your a portion of your risk is mitigated by the simple fact that you are concluding a buying frenzy is unlikely to occur making sold calls safer Consider the bloodbath of the past few weeks Stocks are tumbling but GME it's basically stayed very consistent Some stocks are down 20/30 percent but GME is basically flat How people aren't selling and they also aren't buying that much x200B Open Interest Open interest is sometimes confused with trading volume but the two terms refer to different measures On a day when one trader who already holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to a new trader entering the market the transfer of contracts does not create any change in the open interest figure for that particular option No new option contracts have been added to the market because one trader is transferring their position to another However the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer does increase the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts What strikes are people buying calls for expiry 3/5 x200B Strike Open Interest In the money 30 63 Yes 40 598 Yes 45 4612 Yes 50 1597 Yes 135 5500 Yes 140 14 000 No 250 4854 No 300 5446 No 800 30 000 No All the ITM calls retained value and can be sold or exercised all OTM calls are worth NOTHING x200B Is there any surprise that it ended up this way Ending the week above $140 would have caused option sellers to either buy back or get assigned for 14 000 100 1 400 000 shares x200B If you were an option seller and you were smart enough to buy GME at $50 and you sold covered calls or naked calls at $140 and you saw it at $140 what would you do Sell your shares to lower the price Consider shorting it to lower the price Buy the underlying to hedge against the oncoming ass fucking this is a gamma sqz Literally anything but give retards on wsb 1 4Million GME shares worth of money Here's a list of the things you would NOT do Stop selling super deep OTM C800 calls Stand by and watch and risk losing your 5th yacht while working class assholes take your money x200B Jail is for poor people never forget that It's not for rich people x200B Let's look at what some folks are buying these days x200B Do you guys see what the problem is yet People are spending their money buying these retarded calls that have no chance of success x200B Remember when I said earlier that if you sell a call and you have money it's in your best interest to use that money to increase your chance of success It makes sense to spend as much much as you need to to mitigate risks If you winning cost them $100 000 000 and it will only cost them $99 999 999 99 to make sure you don't expire ITM guess what THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT THING This is the basic economics of opportunity cost For you retards that didn't take economics or don't read it means the valuable path is derived by comparing it to all other paths x200B Obviously they're not spending all of their premium to make sure options expire ITM if they were it'd be a bad trade to begin with These folks are smart they know math understand probability and have a deep understand of options arbitrage orders limits etc x200B So what am I saying TLDR Buying super far OTM calls is fucking retarded You're just handing the people you're trying to beat free money It's harder to win when you keep giving all the advantages to the people you're trying to take money from Yes of course they could become the biggest gainers but they are the last calls that will become profitable So say we had a gamma sqz to 790 and you hold until near expiration Guess what Theta option price decay over time murdered all your money because you wanted to spend all your cash on the absolutely least likely successful call Buying ATM/ or close OTM Next Strike has a very real possibility of actually making you money Those options might actually cause a price increase If people who bought calls were stacked ATM near the current market price this could very easily start a gamma squeeze Every seller doesn't want to get fucked so every single one of them is going to try to cover their own ass Like if the options were something like 135 15 000 140 12 000 145 20 000 150 15 000 SUDDENLY All of the call sellers become potential panic buyers afraid of losing their Manhattan condo Do you see the difference Every time a strike is hit the next strike becomes almost destined to be hit The amount of shares needed to cover those sold calls forces the price up if they're exercised

Discussion I gotta say I see some good shit out there I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money This is the path my fellow retards I'm a nobody here but I have good returns and some good insight When I came to WSB multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing because I knew jack shit I care more about my money than yours but no retard should be left in the dark alone So let me pass on a couple things I can't prove shit to you so read this or don't I mainly trade options Calls and Puts so that is what I will discuss Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index While riskier this is where you can hit the homeruns So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings While what I said is true I am usually against putting everything into a single bet Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100 guaranteed The goal of this game is to stay alive You will lose money on a play at some point because it is inevitable So never let yourself get wiped out because you can always build yourself back up This goes along with one of my other recommendations always have SOME cash ready to go You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out Paper hands and diamond hands are just words You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take One of my favorite strategies is to say buy an even number of options on a play sell half at a modest level of gains like enough to break even or gain a little bit and then let the rest ride longer Look guys on many plays you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red Some people will bail at 40 gains and others might not take anything less than 500 Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor so YOU decide when it's time Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy Here's a couple psychological principles in investing Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning Think about this before you sell Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position Trust your DD and stick to the plan I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed only to see them moon Diamond Hands means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands I'm a retard and we're in a bull market so often times the stock will eventually go up Your call though The market makers and big boys want you to lose They want your money I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use but just point out some simpler tactics they will use Big money often sees retail as weak hands aka Buy High and Sell Low They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs We're in a bull market which means stonks only go up However we still have negative days Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad Generally the dip is not time to sell but instead time to buy Case and point we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago Do you know what the big money did They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap We've been mooning ever since Sometimes shit makes no sense A company can have blowout earnings exceed expectations and the stock will tank I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day It was total bullshit and I knew it I trusted my DD So instead of panic selling I added to my position Sure enough the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all time high just 2 weeks later This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy Option Expiration Dates matter Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way However it can often be a noob trap One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position Stocks trade sideways sometimes Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason So give yourself TIME to work with Time costs money and hurts profit margins But it is better to consistently make 50 profit than to hit one play for 300 followed by 10 losers Look playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits I do at least one or more every week The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit Remember no tendies no more fun Along the same lines Strike Price matters An OTM Out of the Money option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out I personally enjoy using them some people don't But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential If your call relies on a stock gaining 50 in 2 weeks then well it's probably not gonna happen ITM In The Money options means that your stock is already within the strike price ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need Leaps are fuckin dope A Leap is a call but for a much longer period of time I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap Given that the market trends up over time you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way A lot of people buy ITM leaps but again I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot Implied Volatility IV Extremely fucking important IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction High IV Expensive Options It's fucking weird to think but you can make similar profits from a 2 move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5 move on a more volatile stock Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon High IV is riskier so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report ER will be more expensive due to IV Trying to play ER is usually for suckers unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER The company will deliver great news and then dump hard You may see people bitching about this very soon Basically big money knew ahead of time it would be good so the stock got pumped and then they took profits Buy the rumor and sell the news Events press releases and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap You will get shit on Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though Finally get busy learning Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money Learn about the general market Stocks are grouped into Sectors or categories Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options so that's on you The first thing you need to do is to learn what the Greeks are That will teach you how options function If anyone wants to talk or discuss send me a message I'm a degenerate with no life Oh and if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you I've come up with some genius shit but I've also lost on some retarded calls Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20 May the gains be with you,2021-02-09 18:11:06,"8. {""NULL""}"

Microvast ($MVST) -The only DD you'll ever need,2407,oz4ka3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz4ka3/microvast_mvst_the_only_dd_youll_ever_need/,659,1628248495.0,Microvast $MVST The only DD you'll ever need Listen up retards this won't be short This was not meant for you apes Seek ing alpha denied my article because they don't want recent SPACs merger on their website So instead of earning cash to spend it on stupid shit I'm here wasting my time for you all because I don't want 50 hours and 4000 words of research to go to waste let me tell you gamblers why Microvast $MVST is a Hidden gem First of all you retards probably came for the short squeeze potential rumor has it there's not many shares left to short sell and Microvast is down 60 from its peak even after yesterday's 20 run but I could not care less about that MVST will trade significantly higher once decent analysts start coverage on it and this post will tell you why You guys are so lucky to have found this now I've been holding since November when it was $11 so the price right now is still dirt cheap it was $15 two weeks ago Quick introduction for those of you who don’t know what Microvast is and what it does Microvast is a technology innovator for Li ion batteries that designs develops and manufactures battery systems for commercial electric vehicles and energy storage that feature ultra fast charging capabilities long life and superior safety Microvast believes the ultra fast charging capabilities of its battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles and believes the long battery life of its battery systems reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles Microvast is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 87 their estimates are justified by the growing desire for electrification as well as the growing demand for clean energy and the zero carbon revolution The forecasted battery components revenues see picture below come from Microvast being vertically integrated Their battery components are world class significantly differentiating and they are going to sell those parts to some key cell manufacturers in the passenger EV market specifically their aramid separator and their gradient cathode They currently ship to passenger vehicle applications SAIC but are also engaging with passenger OEMs that have made the announcement that they will manufacture their own batteries with battery components 1 They also plan to do the same thing with consumer electronics x200B Microvast's projected revenues While their projections may seem optimistic they were able to secure partnerships with industry leaders representing over $1 5 Bn in contracted revenue through 2027 $44 millions $125 millions $172 millions $250 millions and $355 millions for 2021 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively Those numbers were before they recently announced a partnership with eVersum a high tech vehicle OEM specialized in the design development and build of the most purposely engineered electric commercial vehicles for passenger transport The deal has a potential volume forecasted to be more than 100 million € There’s a great interview on cheddar news with Shane Smith COO of Microvast where he talks about why Microvast went public and raised more than $800 million “We raised capital to support orders we already had in place We’ve won more business than we’ve had capacity for” It seems like Microvast has a great problem the demand is bigger than the supply at the moment which is great news as they may not need to spend a lot on marketing if customers are coming to them directly Microvast has over a decade of expertise in designing and manufacturing battery components Cells electrolytes packs separators That differentiates them from most of the other battery makers who source their components from the vendors It is important to note the cell makers do not have the right to produce the material that they did not invent or have the license for “Microvast invented and manufactures the key battery materials to ensure unique performance and by also guaranteeing the leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents legally protected and our success is founded on our deep technology portfolio which is wholly owned and protected by over 550 patents and patent applications ” said Dr Mattis Chief Technology Officer of the company They have more than 1800 employees including more than 500 employees in the R D division They have 28000 Battery systems in operation in 19 different countries More than 3 8Bn Miles of operational distance was covered with no major safety incidents Their Batteries can run at a high temperature for a long time and they won’t explode They have this proprietary way for their Batteries to be 90 as efficient as brand new ones after 10 000 charges Among all of Microvast’s products two stands out that no one else in the world has the 100 Aramid separator and the full concentration of the grading of the material o “One of the perks for the solid state battery is on shrinking separators and with our Aramid separator we are there” Dr Wenjuan Mattis said in the Wedbush conference held on April 8th2021 For the fans of solid state batteries this could be a major catalyst incoming Their Aramid separator has higher thermal stability than charged cathode material 2X the temperature resistance of traditional poly ethylene separators enhancing safety and charging time o “We have almost 15 patents in solid state batteries it’s one of the three advanced technologies that we’re working on” said COO Shane Smith 15 might not look like a lot compared to QuantumScape which holds over 200 patents and patent applications related to solid state battery technology but they operate in different markets MVST in commercial vehicle batteries and QS more in the passenger EV batteries Also it’s important to mention that they are not really competitors at the moment Microvast generated about $ 107 million in sales in 2020 and is expecting to generate more than $2 billion in sales in 2025 compared to QuantumScape which will not generate meaningful revenues until 2026 according to the website “ barrons com The other material the full concentration grid in the cathode is a unique material made by Microvast With this technology they can tune the distribution of the transition metals across the particles which allows them to maximize the capacity and maintain safety and at the same time minimize the cost and the risk by reducing the cobalt content The material has a capacity 20 higher than the best material in the market and is 10 lower in cost They have a production line that has been making 600 tons per year for the past 3 years Partnership/Customers They have solid partnerships including FPT the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group Oshkosh leading global innovator of mission critical vehicles and essential equipment Porsche SAIC and many more Oshkosh also made a $25MM strategic investment in the PIPE and signed joint development agreement highlighting future battery collaboration and integration It is worth mentioning that Oshkosh received the USPS contract to replace its mail delivery trucks the initial contract is worth $482 million Also it is an open contract meaning USPS will be able to order more vehicles throughout the 10 year contract they will order between 50 000 and 165 000 vehicles This is a lot of potential business for Microvast and could represent a serious catalyst in the future once more information is available Oshkosh expects to start production in 2023 right when Microvast’s factory in Tennessee will be up and running Remember MVST went from $14 to $23 the day Oskosh got the USPS contract this will definitely be a HUGE catalyst once we know more about it They can count as their customers some of the leading global bus OEMs including Yutong Higer Foton King Long VDL and Wright Bus Their batteries are being deployed across a broad range of commercial vehicles including automated guided vehicles port equipment mining trucks fork lift trucks They also have customer relationships with the likes of Kion Kalmar KoneCranes Linde PSA Singapore and Gaussin All of these names are recognized as leading OEMs in their particular area of focus Key advantages over its competitors Microvast is very unique in itself and it is hard to compare them with other public companies some are fairly young compared to them and others are well established but operate in the passenger EV battery market and it is unclear when/if they will shift towards the manufacturing of commercial EV batteries Their closest competitor is probably had to get rid of this competitor market cap under 1bill but the short answer is that MVST is 10 times better If we do a quick head to head comparison we can see Microvast seems to have a clearer path to achieve its Revenue goals is headquartered in Los Angeles with a factory of 113K sq ft compared to Microvast with its biggest factory in China 1 72MM sq ft another one in Germany 170K sq ft and one in the United States in 2022 577K sq ft In contrast has more than 200 employees and Microvast is expected to hire around 300 employees only for their new factory in Tennessee and they also have more than 500 employees working in the R D division as mentioned before It looks like Microvast is better positioned to profit from global electrification with their factories established in three different parts of the world The picture below shows both their year over year revenues growth which could be a bit misleading as they are not in the same business stage and operate in different continents for now China and Europe lead the United States in electric commercial vehicles on the road which could explain the difference x200B But the point I want to make here is that they rely on different things miss on revenues is due to the short term limited number of battery cell providers producing safe high performance cells suitable for the commercial electric vehicle market “We know we and the whole industry need more cells” said the CEO of in their latest earnings call Whereas Microvast produces their own cells relying more on the primary resources See the picture below for Microvast 2021 projected Revenues as well as forecasted and revised revenues x200B On the other hand it is true that Microvast did not have earnings call yet to discuss their 2021 outlook but I believe they are in line to achieve their projected revenues They had $107 MM in revenues in 2020 and if they keep the same YoY growth rate of 115 Q1 2020 à Q1 2021 they will get to $230 MM by the end of the year The key differentiator here is that Microvast manufactures their own cells which ensures high quality faster product development greater customization to client needs and tighter cost control as well as higher margins The fact that Microvast has its own in house manufacturing capacity is a clear competitive advantage to my eyes see picture below found on Microvast website x200B Both of these companies are currently highly valued based on their potential and future expected revenues At their current market cap is selling at an estimated 2021 P/S ratio between 23 and 51 and MVST with an estimated 2021 P/S ratio of about 12 Once again these two companies are not at the same business stage and I believe they will both succeed and grow at an impressive pace however MVST’s growth perspective and business model seem less risky and more predictable I have a conservative 2023 Price target on MVST of $25 that was for Seeking Alpha let's be real here $25 is legit fair value for Microvast it should trade at a premium for all its potential not a discount which is more than a 200 increase from its current price of about 8$ and $25 also happens to be their 52 week high My price target is based on discounted 2023 revenues and a P/S ratio of 12 85 of forecasted 2023 revenues 85 751MM 12 $7 5 billion market cap Considering their direct competitor is currently more expensive P/S between 23 51 and other companies operating in a similar sector are trading at high valuations Tesla 20 P/S Pro terra 11 P/S QuantumScape Market cap of 9 5B without revenues yet and Nikola Market cap of 4B without revenues yet Microvast can be considered as fairly cheap and this price target of $25 as conservative It could easily go to $40 is what I meant TAM is estimated to be $30Bn in 2025 · Battery providers are expected to play a pivotal role in the EV value chain 30 40 of EV value resides in the battery · The rotation from gas powered commercial vehicles to electric powered commercial vehicles might happen quicker than the rotation from gas passenger cars to electric passenger cars because of government funding Also with the lithium shortage the world will have to mine more lithium but it would not make sense to use powered gas trucks to mine to then build electric batteries for a greener future I believe the U S government as well as the other governments will make sure we use clean energy to mine lithium or any other natural resources which would benefit Microvast · The demand is bigger than the supply at the moment with battery cell production in the U S just below 40 GWh in 2020 while battery demand exceeded 42 GWh For context achieving President Biden’s goal of a 100 electric fleet of U S government vehicles will require 69 GWh of battery cells I believe Microvast is well positioned to become a giant in the industry with their new factories they planned ahead which could give them a competitive advantage over their competitors · EV Battery market is believed to be at a key inflection point EV is 1 5 of 2020 sales – 8 5 by 2025 which equals to an expected CAGR of 55 based on sales in key markets U S Europe China Japan South Korea Source Microvast investors presentation Ø There is a profound energy transition toward renewable energy driven by governmental policies that are synchronized for the first time according to Frederique Carrier in the RBC Global insight May 2021 o The European Green Deal refocused the EU’s COVID 19 stimulus package onto renewables charging infrastructure power generation and green hydrogen projects allocating up to $600 billion to green projects o China’s 14th Five Year Plan called for electric vehicles to constitute 20 percent of overall new car sales in China by 2021 from just 5 now spending up to $1 5 trillion o Joe Biden won the U S presidential election with a sweeping infrastructure program up to $2 trillion o Microvast is well diversified in these three growing markets with its biggest factory in China 1 72MM sq ft one in Germany 170K sq ft and another one in production in the United States 577K sq ft expected to start production in 2022 According to Shelby Tucker RBC Capital Markets LLC Utilities Analyst the global market for batteries has the potential to grow 100 times by 2050 Also great find by u/Little Objective 683/ The U S department of energy DOE asked Microvast in 2019 to build a Li ion battery facility in the United States to fulfill Microvast's biggest order to date which will make Microvast the largest American Li ion Manufacturer x200B Global market presence After primarily being focused on the PRC and Asia Pacific regions they are expanding their presence and product promotion to Europe and the United States to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets In 2021 they will be launching a marketing campaign to introduce Microvast to more potential customers in regions outside the Asia Pacific region and adding more headcounts to support business development source Sec gov DEF14 form The European market presents enormous growth opportunities for electric vehicles driven by higher emission standards reduced total cost of ownership compared to gas based combustion engines and growing environmental awareness In the United States they believe a new political administration is likely to push the electrification revolution through regulation In pursuing contract opportunities with industry leading companies in the United States they have seen how their potential customers recognize the lower total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles and are seeking alternative forms of energy for energy storage applications As they expand their presence globally they will continue to invest in their existing partnerships in the PRC and the Asia Pacific region and continue to grow their business there x200B Revenues in Europe decreased by about 22 while Revenues in PRC increased by more than 260 I believe the decrease in Europe is temporary and was caused by the pandemic since it affected the whole industry as Panasonic mentioned in their latest earnings report and with the new factory in Germany it will become more convenient for European companies to try and buy Microvast’s products According to the website iea org new electric car registrations were about 3 million globally in 2020 and for the first time Europe led with 1 4 million new registrations followed by China with 1 2 million and the United States with 295 000 new electric cars Bear Case I could not find solid bear cases anywhere on Microvast other than “it’s a Chinese company stay away” or “insiders are dumping shares on you get out” Let’s talk about the latter quickly As found on the sec gov DEF14 filing for THCB SPAC that merged with Microvast “Subject to certain exceptions the Registration Rights and Lock Up Agreement further provides 1 Wu will be subject to a lock up of one year with respect to 25 of his shares and a lock up of two years for the remaining 75 of his shares provided that with respect to the 25 of his shares subject to the one year lock up he can sell those shares if the shares trade at $15 00 or above for 20 days in any 30 day period and 2 the Microvast equity holders other than Wu are subject to a six month lock up The Registration Rights and Lock Up Agreement further provides that the shares owned by the Sponsor Group will be subject to a lock up Specifically with respect to 75 of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group a 2/3rds of such shares are subject to a one year lock up unless the shares trade at $12 50 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period and b the remaining 1/3rd of such shares are subject to a one year lock up With respect to the remaining 25 of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group a 50 of such shares are locked up until the later of the one year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $12 00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period b the remaining 50 of such shares are locked up until the later of the one year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $15 00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period and c all of such shares are subject to forfeiture if such trading targets are not met by the fifth anniversary of the Closing ” In other words insiders are not “dumping shares on us” at a price of about $8 now $10 because of their lock up agreement Should you fear Microvast because it is a Chinese company Perma bulls will tell you it is not a Chinese company as it is headquartered and founded in Houston Texas In reality it really is a Chinese battery maker coming public through an American SPAC according to Dana Blankenhorn let's not argue about this fellow retards it doesn't really matter China is years ahead of the U S in EV If you were on vacation the past couple of weeks here’s what happened with the Chinese stocks A crackdown on education has spread to Chinese tech stocks and the whole Chinese market MSCI China index delivered negative returns of 14 in July Investors fear the unpredictability of the Chinese government which could explain the 40 drop in MVST share price in a month So the question is should you be greedy when others are fearful as Warren Buffet said Or should you panic sell after a 40 drop in a month Here’s what UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefel had to say on China “For the tech sector Beijing remains focused on its long term goal of technological self sufficiency and leadership on the global stage We believe the regulatory risk will continue in the socially sensitive sectors of property And healthcare we don’t expect the government will push these sectors to non profit either” Another important part that Mark Haefel discussed is directly related to Microvast “Offshore equities are pricing in a higher risk premium This is likely to linger in the near term However we think Future returns will be largely driven by earnings growth mainly from cyclical and value sectors this year We recommend investors cherry pick stocks across sectors that are supported by earnings growth but have limited regulatory risk exposure Our preferred sectors include consumer durables and services energy and Greentech ” In the short term who knows where the stock price can go however if Microvast delivers on their promises we will most likely see abnormal returns I understand the risk of companies operating in China but what I particularly like about Microvast is that they are diversifying away from China with their factory in Germany and one incoming in the United States they will be on three different continents which is worth something to my eyes Let’s summarize what has been said before with a SWOT Analysis SWOT AnalysisStrengths Ø Unlike competitors who redesign existing batteries to fit them in EVs Microvast has designed its batteries from the ground up specifically to address the problems facing EV batteries Every step of the manufacturing process is controlled by Microvast leading to higher quality and lower cost products Ø Researchers from Microvast have developed a novel high power battery technology that has a higher energy density longer life and safer operation than any other state of the art lithium ion battery on the market The system is built from four breakthrough technologies and could potentially be used in plug in hybrid electric vehicle and fully electric vehicle markets Because of its many benefits the technology has the potential to also enhance the performance of lithium ion batteries used in cell phones and other smaller scale applications as well as in electric grid applications Ø $ 1 5B total contracted revenue in Pipeline through 2027 which will help Microvast to grow revenue at an expected CAGR of 87 from 2020 2025E Weaknesses Ø Being a “Chinese company” U S investors might not like it as much as a U S company Ø Portfolio Managers being scared of investing in SPACs or even the “deSPACs phase “after the SPACs controversy in the beginning of 2021 Opportunities Ø There is three substantial untapped markets that Microvast plans on expanding their products offering to Passenger Vehicles PV Energy Storage Solutions ESS and Battery Components Consumer Electronics which could expand their TAM by $45B Ø 2021 Begin Battery Production in the area of Berlin Germany Ø 2022 Begin Battery Production in Clarksville TN Threats Ø Susceptible to disruption many companies are trying to improve EV batteries and might not need Microvast in the foreseeable future Ø The Prices of Lithium ion batteries have been plummeting over the past decade and that trend is expected to continue in the coming years which could impact Microvast’s profit margin Ø Other companies are working hard on lowering EV battery costs one or more of them could make a battery substantially cheaper than Microvast To conclude I believe the growth opportunity in the commercial EV battery sector is impressive as well as somewhat predictable as it makes sense for companies to go electric economically financially and environmentally Microvast is well positioned to capture a great portion of the total addressable market of $30 Bn and has the opportunity to dramatically increase their TAM if they expand their business to consumer electronics passenger EV batteries and energy storage solutions market The fact that Microvast went public through a SPAC merger less than a week ago gives retail investors an edge to generate alpha as analysts have not started to cover the company yet Microvast also fits the criteria of sustainable investing a trend that is not about to die anytime soon Overall Microvast has everything it needs to become a successful company it now just needs to deliver on its promises So the real question is does the upside outweigh the downside You tell me Disclaimer I own shares and warrants of MVST I am not a financial advisor this should not be used as financial advice 1 Wedbush presentation 4/8/2021,2021-08-06 14:14:55,

MVIS: Shiny Laser Go Pew ⚡ No But Seriously They Are Gonna Take Over The LiDAR Industry,1510,ljgtxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/,654,1613304052.0,MVIS Shiny Laser Go Pew ⚡ No But Seriously They Are Gonna Take Over The LiDAR Industry So the day has come and MicroVision's market cap is finally big enough so that you won't get banned for mentioning it on WSB But what is it Why have they seen an 800 increase in three months Where are they headed Allow me to explain About Them MicroVision Inc MVIS makes futuristic as fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne VLDR which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars Sumit Sharma the CEO was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola also worked at Jawbone Source Why have they been increasing 800 in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition and they were are criminally undervalued The reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet and on paper MVIS looks like shit Low assets high liabilities Even I saw the movement back in December did some research and was like Wtf is this I need to get puts But once you do research into their product who their customers are and the future of the industry that they are involved in you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000 have struggled to make it to 2020 but now are about to finally have their heyday And they got a $13 million equity facility loan in December that greatly improved their balance sheet making them appeal to institutions and bringing Vanguard and Blackrock to invest in MVIS days later I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020 but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential I go over that in the comments MVIS left vs PLUG right 1990's until present Anyways what is this much more advanced technology I'll just let this chart do the talking The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self driving cars that will be coming in April The resolution it can take as input/second the points per second is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see how accurately it can identify what it is seeing and how quickly it can react That chart is from 2 years ago and still the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4 800 000 pps in their most advanced model the Alpha Prime 3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2 Single Return Mode 2 400 000 points per second Dual Return Mode 4 800 000 points per second VLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet but historically their top of the line devices cost $75 000 I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime costing $100 000 That was last year will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase They did announce a $500 model called the Velarray H800 in November but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its outstanding lol As for Luminar LAZR they will launch the new model Iris in 2022 which will cost about $1 000 the same price as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April It will also only operate at 10Hz This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS If you know anything about video games you know that this is unplayable Iris will cost less than $1 000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance or ADAS Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022 ' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present a representative told me and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available A lengthy post has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was 300dpi/spdeg a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions 3D points per second Here's the math I sum it all up at the bottom Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of up to 200 points per square degree and a FOV of 120° x 30° degrees and 300 points for Iris the one coming in 2022 However the vertical FOV can be configured from 1° to 30° which likely explains the use of up to in the resolution numbers Generally as FOV expands resolution shrinks assuming a constant pixel stream This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2 YT links aren't allowed apparently while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so Specifically regarding Luminar is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120° x 30° Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as for example 120° x 5° The use of up to suggests the latter Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120° x 30° is available which is not conceded given the stated up to that would yield a total resolution of 720 000 points MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second At a resolution of 720 000 points Luminar would require a frame rate of 27 7 Hz to equal 20M points per second Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more mechanical including as per a recent patent spindles and a drive belt 1 At video time 19 56 Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar Iris will support resolution of 300 points per square degree at 10 Hz Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz 10 8M points per second If the 300 points/ sq deg applies only to a smaller FOV the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller Microvision claims 20M points per second for its current MEMS lidar The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec TLDR The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10 8 million pps but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations careful wording by press releases and Hz limitations Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments this post is long enough already Again the MicroVision Consumer LIDAR specifications being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self driving cars Their device specialized for cars the 1st gen Long Range LiDAR LRL Sensor will be coming in April We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters This equates to 520 points per square degree For those who read the math on LAZR notice he doesn't say up to It testing is successful the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self driving applications Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real time 30 Hz sensor output This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 L3 autonomous safety and Level 4 L4 autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties What is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving Level 1 is feet off level 2 is hands off level 3 is eyes off level 4 is mind off and level 5 is full passenger you can sit in the back So basically they have that 2045 technology today while everyone else is trying to play catch up How is it so advanced It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors I've seen MVIS's LiDAR in action at a shareholder meeting It can recognize people This has been described on MicroVision's conference calls and has been described with significant additional safety and convenience features This could identify individual people Can distinguish between pets and people or YOUR pet and the neighbors pet Can distinguish between normal behaviors and strange things that could be of concern Could save face scans of intruders and allow intruders to be identified later Source If their devices can really recognize people objects and pets it could integrate security verticals in MicroVision's business model Video surveillance is expected to reach a 144 5 B market size by 2027 Why not just use cameras Cameras are worse at long distances LiDAR is the only sensor that gives you resolution at range the ability to get very fine and very accurate detection of objects in space that's why Teslas use radar systems in addition to their cameras still not good enough to prevent fatalities on the road using Tesla's full self driving software Also cameras struggle with light glare weather and 3D imaging while LiDAR fixes all those issues The main advantage of cameras are their resolution and MicroVision is bridging the gap So will testing be successful We expect the capability of our LRL Sensor to meet or exceed OEM requirements based on technology we have scaled multiple times over the last decade as being a very strong strategic advantage Same source This product has been getting fine tuned for years and I am personally confident that they will be able to outperform in their testing Demonstration YT links aren't allowed apparently of their consumer LiDAR product from 2018 make sure your quality is all the way up x200B Growing Industry The self driving cars market is expected to reach 220 44 billion dollars by 2025 This includes taxi civil public transport heavy duty trucks ride shares and ride hail UBER 72 B mkt cap applications Traffic Accidents in the US alone Cost 871 Billion A Year even just yesterday there was an insane pileup on the I 35W highway in Texas that killed 6 injured 36 and damaged 133 vehicles Not only self driven cars need LiDAR In a few years as soon as MicroVision's 1st Gen LRL is available LiDAR systems will certainly become mandatory for still human controlled cars to avoid collisions This tech could become as revolutionary and successful as airbags Airbags are a 37 3 billion dollar industry If only 10 of the cars produced annually contain four Microvision LRL systems this will result in a volume of 364 million units in ten years 9 1 million cars 4 modules 10 years And this is a conservative calculation both a higher market share more cars produced and more modules per car are conceivable At least 4 LRL devices will be necessary to establish a circle of safety x200B Augmented Reality The Hololens 2 is an example of a Virtual Reality Device VRD manufactured by Microsoft that uses MicroVision MEMS Laser Scanning display modules inside NASA Lockeed Martin using Hololens Video YT links aren't allowed

see a reduction in cost increases in quality' 'What we've found is we can take an 8 hour activity and reduce it down to 45 minutes' 'We haven't had a single error that's been documented' From 2002 2006 MVIS commercialized versions of a monochrome red VRD for industry and the military It was called Nomad Microvision also developed a full color version for the military the Spectrum SD2500 The military alone currently intends to spend almost $3B on IVAS augmented reality devices that use MicroVision tech in the next several years Video at 1 12 based on Microsoft's Hololens amazing must

quantitatively much higher performance product than both of its competitor companies Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses healthcare engineering military equipment GPS safety entertainment and interactive projectors They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point due to grow massively in the near future Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years I have never seen a company with such low insider selling that the last case of a sale was in 2014 Institutional investors are piling in as MicroVision's balance sheet improves and they near the April LRL sensor test date which has a high likelihood of being a success I think this stock should currently be valued at 20 Billion dollars taking all of this into account and expect it to rise drastically over the next few years This is not

amplification factor of 1 🍌 6 🍌 OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO ers 🦍 but carry very high risk of 🦍 loosing all 🍌 if 3/12 closing price ends below 270 A safer way for 🦍 would probably be ITM calls somewhere around the 100 110C strike price This would still gives 1 🍌 3 🍌 in delta hedge amplification The 270C 3/12 was then quoted by the Forbes article on gamma swarm Wednesday Night 3/10 Imagine that a swarm of say 10 000 members each invested $1 000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12 The March 9 cost of the option is $24 If all option sellers hedged it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume at the then current prices A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk They would have covered hedged by purchasing shares – adding to the surge Gamma power What most of you degenerates did

brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME Looking at this graph the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19 and with it the gamma amplification affect With the 3/12 gone that's almost 30 of the calls OI but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30 of calls OI The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days there's still a chance for gamma I have no opinion on the short interest maybe hedgies covered maybe they printed shares out of thin air I don't know But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention span is limited to a few months a best and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE A NICE DAY she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post if u like her graphs upvote her comments $GME Price probability based on IV $GME IV Put/Call Inversion on long dated options According to her blue is the implied vol from puts red is the implied vol from calls higher IV means it's trading at higher premium so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time so in the near term puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is 50 then in the medium long term july and onward calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long dated puts I can't comment on the business transformation I'm not an e commerce expert I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc What I do know for sure is that if $GME is bought by X of float net buy EOD share price will close up Y EOD You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES If you bought shares it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20 EOD with ITM safer /ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take 18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry With the 3/12 now expired the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower around 40 MM USD net ITM safer /ATM calls needed that's about 40 000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌 TL DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI 🦍🦍🦍 together strong YOLO ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C

saying sell your GME I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young If you don’t agree with me just say so I’m also not a financial advisor so make up your own minds you autistic fucks But BUT yesterday we did something they’ve never seen Yesterday we made them run out of NOK shares That’s what that big spike was and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h If we keep doing that it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late Impossible you say Too many shares you say Well listen up Yesterday in ONE DAY we traded or caused others to trade 1bn shares of Nokia That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world That’s never happened EVER Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world 3516 16 of average trading volume Do you get it They’ll keep dumping their stock we keep buying them cheap and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY ONE DAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Why do they stop trading in NYSE Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market and once they had enough they started again That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze But then we did it again And they had to stop again The price just wouldn’t go down The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them Everyone is watching us What we do millions of normal folks do with us and every wallstreet asshole does against us What did the asshole brigade do They started shorting NOK They will continue to do that because they think we’re retards they are correct But how come the price didn’t go down It’s got 5bn shares and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there How is this going to work Because the retard brigade was buying it There’s 3m of us and counting If we each put 600 bucks on NOK we get 100 shares and that’s 300m shares Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it AND FUCKING HOLD And every dip you see you buy more AND FUCKING HOLD They'll keep dumping we keep buying until they realize the price isn't going down Then they start buying we keep holding the market runs out of NOK Price skyrockets And normies outside were following us They can see that the stock is still LOW lower than 2016 This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them So why do the normies follow us on this and not on GME I’m not saying sell GME Because GME has never ever been anywhere near where it is now That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit Not so with NOK Even with the spike from yesterday NOK is still DOWN from 2016 Remember 2016 Remember that being a really big year for Nokia No me neither And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph You know what is going to be a big year 2021 and 2022 Why What else did NOK say yesterday Well they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit what do I know I’m not a techie But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that But why would NOK be the company Well remember the 5G war with China US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China because then China has our networks But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of Fucking FINLAND Finland the land of NOKIA So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist Sorry Finnish people nobody gives a shit about you Good thing for you cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world Want proof They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON And we’re going to send them there 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But hang on why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great Answer because Microsoft fucked them That’s right they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down and then buy the phone part of the company These assholes wrecked the company the Finnish economy and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now Worked like a charm Firesale Business restructuring Lost their phones NOK never recovered The asshole they sent from Microsoft Went back to work for Microsoft and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did His name is Stephen Elop Look it up So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes But what don’t they have Money That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works But if we drive the share price up do you think that’s going to change So FUCK IT I’m in for every penny and I am HOLDING I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS TL DR NOK is literally going to the moon Go there with them 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 x200B Edit I've got a lot of messages here are my answers to the most common ones Remember I'm an idiot I don't know shit I see cheap NOK I like cheap NOK I buy cheap NOK I'm not a stockbroker or anything All I know is it's a healthy undervalued company with massive upside potential new space tech etc There is downside risk but the risk is smaller than the potential So if you invest 5k you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days Would I bet a dollar to win 100 if yesterday everyone who bet added 50 to their money Yeah Might lose a quarter but could gain 100 dollars Do I know it's definitely going to happen Of course not What happened yesterday 1bn NOK

Is that too much to ask????",7357,m057ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m057ab/forbes_article_wtf_am_i_a_predator_no_im_a_momma/,639,1615197608.0,Forbes Article WTF Am I a Predator NO I'm a Momma Bear Who Just wants to Provide For Her Kids and Splurge on herself once in a while Is that too much to ask TL/DR Forbes can suck it This is my rant NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday The more I think about it the more pissed I've become about the subtle manipulative and just plain evil condescension The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT Well it was just another headfake y'all The writer was framing US retail investors as the Goliath not as the underdog as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath Its disgusting These media shills including FORBES are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars when THEY actually collude to destroy companies and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit guess what Crickets NOBODY says or does anything about it Not the media not the SEC not the FBI not the DTCC an definitely not Congress The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable But they aren't really going after the hedgies They are going after YOU ME DFV Anyone who dares pull back the curtain But when regular people see a good opportunity and want to invest LEGALLY they lose their shit I don't know ANY of you I don't take advice from anyone here I read and research and then make my own decisions But dammit I see a good opportunity so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool I've jumped on the proverbial train And I will ride it to the end of the line I'm gonna be honest I'm just tired I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces To buy myself my good vehicle or at least fix the one we have It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips I dont even like to drive across Houston just in case the engine light goes on again My credit is not great so I cant finance a car Don't say it I've already tried Twice in 18 months Every time I try again it tanks my credit further And since I'm self employed I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck Therefore the Your job is your credit financing isnt an option either So YA Momma wants a car I want to take a family vacation Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while I want to do fun things and important things like help my kids go to college IF they want to I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need If this makes me a greedy Bitch I guess I'm a greedy bitch But it DOESNT make me a criminal It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market OR that I am part of a premeditated predatory take down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty as FORBES claims ell WE are the cornered defenseless counterparty NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds Are you friggin' KIDDING ME My shares and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price WE the reddit investors are just little ants on a log riding the roaring waters of the market hanging on for dear life And if we HANG ON then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride safe and DRY We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money even maybe our lives to arrive at the end of that beautiful run Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along for playing THEIR game the RIGHT way Truth is these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes their very LIVES playing a rigged game THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed And I'm sorry if they are freaking out But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT TO BE CLEAR My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities I just want to ride the rapids To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming Not because I know I'm so deserving but because I know the numbers don't lie That's not criminal Its not even shady Its SMART I will end up in a calm peaceful lake surrounded by big beautiful mountains I will finally be able to enjoy the view I will send my kids to college buy those braces buy safe car and even go on a beautiful vacation And hey Forbes hey Cramer Hey all you crooks investigating DFV listen up THATS not greedy Its INEVITABLE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO I LIKE THE STOCK EDIT Seriously tho We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles No matter our color gender race religion or political ideology the real war is against evil and corruption For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places Ephesians 6 12 KJV EDIT EDIT Here is the link to the Forbes

GME First of all sorry for my German potato English I am relatively new to this retarded sub started lurking in it around December 2020 I think because that was when I started investing That's also why I don't want to talk about the trading/financial aspects of this whole meme stock situation but want to take a look at the general behavior and use of language the past two months After deeply following the discussions about the effects of fake news filter bubbles the radicalization of individuals through social media and the laws and regulations regarding these topics in the past years including research on these topics for an essay I wrote as a law student which I still am there are certain key words or phrases that have been established in the discussions and DDs regarding GME etc that either make me really angry frustrated or irritated In the past couple of weeks I had these thoughts swirling around and wanted to share them I know confirmation bias is strong in all of us me included but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow and discredit different opinions A civilized discussion where every argument/fact backed standpoint is heared and respected is what brings the best results and answers regardless the topic CNBC FAKE NEWS THE MEDIA IS BOUGHT BY HFs etc I totally see where these claims are coming from the strange amount of articles regarding SLV etc but endlessly repeating these phrases has not a single positive effect In my opinion these phrases aren't apolitical at all and hence shouldn't even be allowed in this sub I'll explain why Not only in the US but also in Germany these phrases portraying established media outlets as fake controlled by XY biased towards left/right are predominantly used by populist groups and people with tendencies towards the conspiracy scene Based on this I can't read these phrases in a non political way especially with all the discussions of the past years in mind That's why I find it irritating to read these phrases over and over again not only in the daily discussion and GME threads but also in popular posts on the hot page of wsb In addition to the previous point I'd like to introduce you to the concept of ambiguity in tolerance Intolerance of ambiguity may be defined as ‘the tendency to perceive i e interpret ambiguous situations as sources of threat’ tolerance of ambiguity as ‘the tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable Wikipedia A phenomenon of social media discussions nowadays is the find that many people are lacking the ability to accept different opinions and to accept the fact that an event or a fact e g GME stock price short may have more than one possible reason or explanation especially if you prefer on of the reasons over the others Regarding our situation this often leads to people down voting hating on and even threatening users who try to show different possible perspectives on the events surrounding the GME craze instead of having an open discussion and being thankful for a broader look on the situation short ladder attacks This term which was used more and more often during the first weeks of February after GME hit its high resurfaced in the past couple of days in many threads and posts even though we had many very solid DDs on why this term and concept is wrong and shouldn't be used I don't know why but I can't read any post with that term in it without a strange feeling in my guts regardless of the overall quality of the post Some additional points Since GME settled at around 40$ we had a new trending post setting a fixed event or date as the MOON TIME almost every day and correct me if I'm wrong but as far as I remember not a single one of these theories became true Most of the time it even felt like it had the opposite effect of letting the stock price drop once reaching the predicted date That's why I stopped trusting these kinds of posts and hyping myself up for then being let down once again The next big date is the 19th of March with many people hoping for that to be the rocket launch And as much as I too wish for it to be true I really don't think we should continue to name fixed dates for a liftoff Regarding that you always have to remember that everything written here can be and most probably is read by not only us little idiot sandwiches but by every single HF social media guy every journalist and every other person who feels the need to waste some time on here My conclusion is that every hype that arises also attracts people who bet on the bursting of it That leads to another point I want to make not every chart action that happens is an evil strategy of a Bond villain like HF Manager As I understand it is a long known and popular strategy to invert the trending stock actions buys/sells of WSB users for profit So keep in mind that every post with for example a solid theory for the next liftoff of GME or a DD for a stock that reaches the hot page attracts many users who try to bet against it which is completely normal After all we are a bunch of individuals In the end of the day everyone has his own profit in mind and not a collective greater good And that's not a bad thing but the inner core of this sub which made it what it is today So all in all think about what you read try to understand different perspectives engage in meaningful discussions ask questions and don't spend too much time on here The squezoozle happens when it does or maybe it won't who knows let the time show it x200B Be nice to each other have a wonderful day and fuck you x200B Position GME 3 200,2021-03-01

I am a Roblox developer and I know the absolute fucking power it

it has NOTE GAME DEVELOPER I make games for fun and do not actually work at $SEARS Not financial advice I have been seeing posts about $SEARS going public on March 10th and I am ecstatic because I truly believe that it will blow up I have been a part of the $SEARS community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works Another person and I have developed 3 $SEARS games that average a mediocre number of 500 players in total during good times of the day Let me tell you the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it It wasn't easy to make as scripting is quite hard and I'm retarded but the games are so bad yet children still play it x200B won't be sharing what those games are for privacy reasons and don't know the extent of whether or not I can get in trouble x200B How much I made in about the span of a month during Christmas time CAD x200B As you can see that is a respectable amount of money considering I split the profits 50/50 and haven't updated the game in literal months Kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform You might be thinking that it isn't that impressive but oooh boy I'm just getting started But first let me get into the details of how $SEARS actually works because it doesn't seem like many people understand it x200B How $SEARS works $SEARS makes money from people spending money on their membership called 'Premium' or from people buying their in game currency called Robux Using the Robux players can buy items from the catalogue whether it's shirts gear or hats/accessories They can also buy in game powerups for different games Everything is community made from the hats and accessories to shirts and games $SEARS used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hat/accessory models $SEARS has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the player made ones Now for how people make money $SEARS has a system called DevEx aka Developer Exchange where developers convert their Robux into actual real life currency The currency exchange rate is 0 0035 USD/Robux There are some restrictions like not being able to exchange Robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange Robux that was made from trading For more info visit Basically when someone purchases something you made you get Robux from it but $SEARS takes a pre determined of the Robux spent and sends it into the void so that they don't have to pay you as much if you DevEx This number is usually 30 $SEARS isn't just a game it's an entire fucking economy $SEARS is interesting because unlike traditional online development you don't have to pay money to keep up servers You can make anything that you want granted that it's not against TOS for absolutely free Now for the juicy stuff This will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big and how much bigger $SEARS is planning to be One thing that I have seen is people talking about how much top $SEARS developers make and the numbers are usually around 40k a month While it depends on how top you are talking about let me just give you an example of how much $SEARS developers make In 2019 a single $SEARS developer made 50 million USD Not only that but a single game has hit 1 6 million concurrent players A single game I got all of this information from the 2020 $SEARS Developer Conference But that's not all from the conference From the conference we got a chart of milestones from $SEARS CEO David Baszucki is trying to hit x200B Note that only the checkmarks mean that it has already happened Thumbs up means that it is on track A funny one I saw was the Tesla one I already know how much ya'll love sucking off Tesla and Elon They are also adding a website where you can hire scripters modellers and sound designers x200B If you are interested I highly recommend that you watch the developer conference as there is so much stuff there that I can't put all into this post Link Statistically $SEARS is bigger than ever and is growing at a rapid rate x200B x200B x200B Another thing that is coming soon that will boost players is updates to the game development engine called Studio $SEARS is constantly made fun of for having shitty games and granted that's not wrong but there are quite a few really good games out there that look pretty nice With the new updates coming games will look better than ever Here's a look at what the new terrain materials and textures will look like They don't even look like $SEARS anymore and people won't be taking $SEARS as a joke x200B x200B x200B Because of this I believe that more and more people will look to get into game development on $SEARS and skyrocket its profits TL DR $SEARS is growing at a rapid rate one person made 50 million USD from developing $SEARS games in a year and $SEARS CEO David Baszucki has huge aspirations for the company which is why I will be going balls deep into $SEARS stock when it goes public Also I have no idea why everyone's calling it $SEARS Edit I now know why people are calling it sears and changed what I could accordingly Also please stop DMing me for financial advice ,2021-02-25 00:11:03,3.

BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,5015,liixji,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixji/blackberry_is_not_a_meme_stock/,626,1613187650.0,BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry in fact is NOT a meme stock You might ask why is that Well here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing and have already developed Partnership with Amazon On December 1st BB announced a multi year agreement AWS which is Amazon’s cloud service business The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform IVY BlackBerry IVY is a scalable cloud connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data normalize it and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud Automakers can use this information to create responsive in vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences Partnership with Baidu On January 25 BB announced the expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu whose high definition maps will run on the QNX® Neutrino® Real time Operating System RTOS and will be mass produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd The milestones build on the company’s January 2018 agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry leading operating system OS the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform BlackBerry QNX BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi BMW Subaru Volkswagen GM Toyota and Honda NVIDIA is even building its AI self driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology BlackBerry IVY In addition to the QNX Operating System their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy which is a cloud based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles BlackBerry Spark Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints Through their UES they plan on improving cross platform visibility cyber threat prevention and remediation while simplifying administration Okay so why is this important 1 BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 million vehicles 2 BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers Audi BMW Ford etc view data and insights on their vehicles This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle even like a problem with the sensors the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update 3 They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products In the future we could see a shift from hardware driven vehicles to software defined vehicles 4 Not only are they focusing on this but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise Unmanaged/BYO use case Gartner Research who published the study even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare IBM and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors In fact NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack And the stock price is still $12 The Sobering Part of this DD After taking a look at their balance sheet I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued especially when compared to their competitors I mean based on this information ALONE the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion with its competitors like Palantir a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about hovering at 60 billion And funny enough Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity just like BlackBerry If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir its stock price would be $110 Final Thoughts Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company Well it’s not With their partnership with Amazon Baidu their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark BlackBerry IVY and their QNX operating system for vehicles it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s future growth Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously But only once people realize that it’s not a meme stock EDIT Well WSB mods have banned me for linking my video Oh well EDIT 2 By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy Also I forgot to mention this to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue $1 1B Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue $1 05B ESTIMATE And again BlackBerry’s Market Cap $7 3B Palantir Market Cap $55 6B

AMC Volume Price Analysis,1894,nnriwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnriwg/amc_volume_price_analysis/,624,1622336102.0,AMC Volume Price Analysis Hey fellow traders Today l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji I love this emoji by the way or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock Here is my analysis based on volume price action and a powerful pattern named the flag high and tight x200B Weekly chart Firstly on the weekly chart we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1 91 1 to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20 36 2 In 17 trading days the stock soared 1065 96 It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag high and tight on falling volume Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90 aim for double in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume I think we easily meet these criteria The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market 1 being the best with an average rise of 69 and throwbacks happening 54 of the time Price meets target 90 of the time The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade In his work Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50 past the breakout point With the measure rule using the breakout point at $12 we would have a theoretical price target of $63 96 1065 96/100/2 12 Now to the analysis based on volume and price On the weekly chart we have the breakout on 3 with rising and above average volume This confirms the breakout is not fake but supported by the professionals After the minor pullback we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume Like we will see on the daily chart the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart I attribute this to two things First the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent Two the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits While it is true the SI rose in this period I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table This being said I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day Like a big cargo ship it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure On top of that the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63 96 in less than 30 days around June 10th following the breakout and we have a 90 chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski If these are not good odds I don’t know what is I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime x200B Daily chart On the daily chart we can see the flag high and tight develop from January 27th on 2 to the breakout at 3 on May 13th Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect On May 14th breakout day 4 we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend Then the test of supply on the pullback at 5 we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals On the second to last candle we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick On 6 we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51 of the time in a bull market which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss If the next day’s close is below this candle Bulkowski tells us there is a 70 chance the candle acts as a reversal So this is to be looked at closely for next week The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line Volatility is cyclical and all this is normal price action Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue Ladies and gents I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship You get in strap on and enjoy the ride Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand Looking back at the daily chart on AMC 1 hanging man and 3 dark cloud cover shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines weak bearish candle by the way would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed x200B 30 minutes chart Lastly on the 30 minutes chart friday we see at 1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25 50 2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price I do believe we have strong support at this level No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way but the odds are that we reach $63 96 by the end of June with a 90 probability according to Bulkowski I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock x200B If history is of any guide I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up Thus I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63 96 AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts Ultimately volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions Cheers 20$ 07/16C AMC 30$ 07/16C AMC Edit Just to be clear Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90 chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target I do NOT plan to sell at this target I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target ,2021-05-30 03:55:02,
Don't expect GME to become worth more than the combined market cap of all other stocks on the planet,345,m082zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m082zn/dont_expect_gme_to_become_worth_more_than_the/,624,1615207679.0,Don't expect GME to become worth more than the combined market cap of all other stocks on the planet I totally expect to wake up tomorrow with a negative karma for posting this but man it needs to be said The total market cap of all stocks IN THE WORLD combined is about 100 trillion It was cute for a bit when everyone was echoing 100k which would put GME at a market cap of 7 trillion Personally I highly doubt this will happen and will not count on it But now the clamor is up to 500k which would be a third of the market cap of the world Not going to happen Soon they will be calling for 1 million which would be 70 trillion almost as much as the market cap of ALL OTHER STOCKS COMBINED and about 40 more than all the stocks in the USA That will not happen The HFs won't physically be able to buy shares for that much And I don't want to hear how Berskshire A is almost 400k They only have 1 5 million shares and make a profit of tens of billions of dollars per year If they had the 70 mil shares that GME has it would be at only 7k It is only a matter of time before people are calling for 5 million or 10 million Don't listen to them That is nutzzzzzz 10 mil would put market cap of GME at 700 trillion which is HALF THE NET WORTH OF PLANET EARTH That is not going to happen Not possible Here is how I see it and nothing here is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor There s a 99 chance that I get it wrong somehow either to the upside or downside 1k is likely 2k is very possible 5k is possible as well but I think a bit of a reach but it could happen for sure 10k is a bit of a reach but still possible 20k not likely 50k very unlikely It would make GME worth almost double apple 100k just not going to happen 500k is a delusion 1 mil is just stupid wishful thinking suggesting 5 million is going to get people hurt If you are counting on 100k expect to be disappointed and expect to walk away with nothing but the shares you hold forever although I put the long term price of GME at pretty close to where it is now If I were to advise anyone anything it is this 1 have a plan 2 have a plan 3 have a plan I cannot stress the first 3 enough 4 don't sell all at once Most likely you did not buy all at once and the last shares you buy will most likely be the best buy maybe not by but by timing 5 count on whatever you think in terms of peak $ and peak time will probably be wrong so plan accordingly 6 be ready to tweak plan if things start to look differently So for now here is my plan just to give an example but you do you as Shakespeare wrong This above all to thine own self be true my first sell will probably be around 1k I will sell probably 100 of my 220 shares which I might turn around and buy back on a big dip For my oldest boy's education fund I will sell about 30 of his 100 For my youngest boy sell 10 of his 50 At 2k I sell 100 more shares keeping 20 and giving me 300k cash which I would be very happy with I sell 60 of my oldest boys remaining giving him 10 left and 170k in his account and 10 more years for me to raise it lets face it 170k would put him through college I sell 35 of my youngest boys giving him 5 left and 80k cash and 14 years to get him enough to go to college At 10k I sell all of my boys remaining shares I sell 25 of my last 30 I hold the last 5 of my shares until I feel we are at the peak or just past the peak Also to note once I sell shares and have cash I will be selling puts to make some more cash I will keep doing this until GME months from now goes back to the 50 60 range and the squeeze is over and a lot of people move on from GME At some point I will get assigned in that range and pick up probably about 1000 shares for me and a couple of hundred for each of my boys to hold long term I won't be able to sell puts for my boys until I get their accounts transferred to TD ameritrade x200B EDIT If you do sell and make money don't forget to save some of that for taxes ,2021-03-08 14:47:59,

Government infrastructure bill is good for EV and autonomous driving growth tech Not even counting patent filings for lasers and scanning devices from MANY interested parties ranging from US to a GLOBAL scale Short Squeeze coming There is significant short interest against MVIS in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS Based purely on the P/E ratio it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy however MVIS value is not in the current earnings it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech and upcoming buyout Look at the short interest borrowed shares and float The shorts are all in and there is about to be a massive short squeeze From a TA perspective we are seeing bullish divergence on the weekly chart We are making higher lows on the weekly and lower lows on the RSI This is bullish divergence a sign that another breakout is coming soon We are also about to see a Golden Cross on both the MVIS chart and the Nasdaq another sign pointing to an upcoming breakout the shorts will be forced to cover soon which will cause a short squeeze Wait until the A Sample PR drops let alone the buyout PR Tesla crashing causing increase in liability and

LiDAR their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW system that integrates onto a chip Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024 MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA 3 years Luminar LAZR LiDAR is currently valued at $8B they were $10B prior to the tech correction and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs size and scalability See the Deep Dive link for detailed competitor analysis Velodyne VLDR Inferior 3D LiDAR does not track velocity 4D inferior resolution specs Ford had a significant stake in Velodyne and sold it shortly after Judy Curran joined the board of MVIS Price Target If we use Luminar’s LAZR valuation as a benchmark we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8 10B $51 $63 50/share I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR so I am estimating $63 5 100/share for the Auto LiDAR vertical More conservatively we can assume that the Auto LiDAR vertical should be worth at least as much as the LAZR valuation of $8B $50/share and I would expect MVIS should be worth more given our LiDAR is superior to LAZR That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals While we don’t know how much these are worth we know the AR verticals just got much more valuable with the $22B contract MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share MicroVision regarding their LiDAR “We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250

EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubble,993,m9zf3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9zf3x/ev_industry_a_spac_fueled_fraud_filled_bubble/,622,1616370536.0,EV Industry a SPAC fueled fraud filled bubble So right now the EV space is starting to look very similar to what weedstocks were in late 2018 Incredible hype unprofitable companies zero sales fraud and mismanagement of investor funds Related to this a week ago another EV stonk $RIDE was being alleged of fraud so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year Disclaimer This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place Not financial advice Some background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018 Roughly three years ago back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle school teacher Ms Wilson's bare tits the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and sending them over the border into Canada Why Canada Turns out the maple syrup sipping beavers up there were about to legalize marijuana Some of the more business oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their jobs at Tim Hortons and buy barns in the middle of nowhere setup weed companies and call them cool names like Blaze It Erryday Co Kush Money Inc and Aphria Inc The empty barns were publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races Retards like us bought everything we could get our hands on weed was about to make us millionaires Turns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in Sales were disappointing low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable the bubble popped and your boys were left holding bags of weed stonks Some of these companies are still around while others are now lol tier pennystocks I was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff so weedstocks it is Okay enough with the history lessons Here's why I think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs New industry with incredible growth expectations from investors A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time Stonks going to the moon Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit Let's move on to what's hot with the SEC right now I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible Note I'm not touching Chinese EVs the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their spyware into and declare the winner Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding too bad I'm about to blast some ass I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies Canoo Inc $GOEV Listed via SPAC Not making profit Not mass producing cars but has plans to start producing a terrible looking minivan in 2022 These minivans will be subscription based revolutionary lifestyle experiences I need to know what these guys are smoking The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025 lmao Rating Lol tier Fisker Inc $FSR Listed via SPAC Not making profit Not mass producing cars but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022 They're strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a 'leasing' type of business model so customers will pay a monthly fee instead of a big upfront payment Foxconn has stated they will be able to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023 Essentially Fisker is drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver 3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible they may have some brain cells Rating Crayon tier Nikola Corp $NKLA Listed via SPAC Not making profit Not mass producing cars but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023 CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year Investigated by the SEC Also that fake truck video was hilarious Didn't find any reliable production estimates The company is allegedly filled with fraud which is why I think this company will never mass produce a car/truck Rating Fraud tier Lordstown Motors Corp $RIDE Listed via SPAC Not making profit Not mass producing cars but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021 Allegations of producing fake pre orders and being years behind of schedule Investigated by the SEC Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024 CEO has stated their factory has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year Rating Fraud tier Lucid Motors $CCIV Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC Not making profit Not mass producing cars but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021 Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point Rating ex TSLA tier Tesla Inc $TSLA Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your mommys nipples Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions OG memestock Only EV company that has a Technoking Incredibly overvalued Multiple reasons pumping valuation Full Self Driving robotaxis being one Go check the 8 2 beta videos that thing is nowhere near autonomous tEsLa iS nOt a CaR ComPanY okay right Rating Meme tier In conclusion Almost every single company in the purely EV space is losing money Most of them aren't producing anything At least a few of them are producing fraudulent data Some of the founders have terrible track records look at the founders of GOEV FSR and RIDE This is 2018 weedstocks all over again Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV Even though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the other turds in the industry Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive and possibly become legit profitable at some point If you think the EV stonk your holding is going to moon this year go look at what happened with weedstocks after 2018 Thank you have a great weekend and good luck next week I know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes Related positions Currently I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated TSLA puts I am however looking into buying puts on the other EV companies listed above ,2021-03-22 01:48:56,

clearly one of you Or something We still say on fleek right I mean I totally know but I'm not sure if you too are you know fellow ape x200B Hmm it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard This makes fellow ape very angry and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this ape honor x200B Anyhow I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the you know non apes about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots but for the non apes this will be good information So let's talk about it x200B What's the deal x200B In late April $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them In exchange for this consideration $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing at a minimum to complete the arrangement over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 and as the most green fuel in the world RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel To make this deal attractive to Bezos ape in training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53 141 755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13 49 to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years That represents about 27 of the company But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that I mean obviously x200B The first 13 283 445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once That happened today The remaining 39 858 310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel a lot of it Half a billion dollars of it by today's value which most people estimate will be worth 1 5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise Again you smart apes already knew this and know that with a present market cap of only 2 23 billion dollars this 1 5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know It must be because I am not a smart ape like you Amazon of course only signed this deal because they figure that 13 49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn x200B Now the part the less intelligent non apes don't seem to grasp but the most important part x200B Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN under terms of the deal will never be permitted to own more than 5 of the company at any given point If they ever go over they've got to give up some shares of the company This is the most important part of that entire deal and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant Basically no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20 of $CLNE at one fucking penny per share and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de leveraged with their 800 baggers Obviously $AMZN is going to want more than the $13 49 a share they're paying which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as gently nudging their distribution partners to go RNG as well And by gently nudging obviously I mean waterboarding until they comply You're already starting to see some of the results of this with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE completely of their own free will of course to partner up for RNG contracts x200B Why does any of this matter x200B Again all you apes that are clearly more smart than me fellow ape but clearly not as clever as the ape collective you know this but it's this If $AMZN's win in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep then in order for $AMZN to win they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13 49 as they keep at their 5 ownership ceiling The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13 49 because that's what $AMZN is paying that's wrong and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards The floor should be 13 49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory SELLING is And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13 49 a share on top of 3 something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money Confusing I know I mean my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46 x200B So there the non apes have it because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it Damn non apes am I right um fellow ape x200B TL DR Bezos is smart ape And you are clearly smart ape Smart apes hang out with each other This is just like being Bezos Except better than Bezos because you smart apes can keep buying more shares Poor Jeff can't Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape x200B Fear and Loathing x200B CD,2021-06-15 11:03:38,

"DDDD - Why GME Might 🚀🌝 Next Week, and How It Could Trigger a Financial Crisis",3884,l9sh9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/,615,1612175147.0,DDDD Why GME Might 🚀🌝 Next Week and How It Could Trigger a Financial Crisis In today's edition of DDDD Data Driven DD we’ll be going over over the details about what happened this week with GME the drama around Robinhood and other brokers and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not GME and other various meme / high SI stocks such as AMC BBBY FIZZ LGND and BB will continue 🚀🚀🚀in its short squeeze this week and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis But first something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit Disclaimer This is not financial advice and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY In fact the numbers facts or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified although reasonable rumors on why Robinhood did this I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee This statement has been refuted by Sequoia I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it they’re a Venture Capital firm not a hedge fund and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks It could be possible that the White House or someone from the government did contact Robinhood actually I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on During this call they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de grossing causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 I’ll talk more about this later Basically without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office Possible intervention from Citadel Securities This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel the hedge fund dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a few days ago who were the very well known shorts of GME Citadel the hedge fund is owned by Citadel LLC which happens to also run Citadel Securities a market maker If you don’t know what this is go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my previous post about this Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy directly being responsible for around 40 of their revenue in 2018 through their payment for order flow i e selling your trades to Citadel giving them the right of first refusal and potentially giving you a worse price this is how they get 0 commission trades btw Theoretically Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls they write 99 of all options contracts and probably not being perfectly Gamma and especially Vega hedged so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there According to WSB hero Chamath he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users granted they already literally do this and do this type of shit The Official Reason Clearing House Limitations Let’s get to the official reason put out by Robinhood which is that their clearing house in this case the Depository Trust Clearing Corp suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically Apparently Robinhood is running out of cash so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC and hence weren’t able to trade through them Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share which can take a few days to finalize this is called settlement However you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons so that’s where the clearing house comes in Let’s call this clearing house Mary What Mary does is facilitate clear this exchange and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange eg Dylan goes bankrupt Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time failure to deliver Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead Since GME suddenly became very volatile and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question at least on the seller’s side DTCC decided or due to pressure from other sources to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading For some reason Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision for fun Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ Class action lawsuit Someone paid to have an airplane fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood” Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision Clearly this decision has single handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now It’s especially bad given the optics their mission is to literally “democratize finance” with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions This decision whether intentional or not has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission and will end the company if not fixed soon All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight although based on the fact that GME is still restricted that doesn’t seem to be enough However in my personal opinion I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation and once they do they will likely re enable trading on GME If that happens which IMO will probably be some time next week GME and all other high SI stocks will absolutely 🚀🌝 How GME Almost Caused and Still Can Cause a Stock Market Crash Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall In fact the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME AMC and other high SI stocks surged with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases this was one of the biggest de grossing of hedge funds in history Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this so amazing that I’ll just copy paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself A children's book explanation of what's happening 1 If you are smart money you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15 2 You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies you can short $15 of stock as well 3 In finance language this means that you are $30 gross $15 of longs $15 of shorts but $0 net $15 of longs $15 of shorts This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk but in reality your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk 4 Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit its called an ideas dinner 5 You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts 6 Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners start copying your longs based on your report 7 You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks you also BUY options puts which has to be reported 8 Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you 9 But then an outsider notices that the math is way off 10 Apparently some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100 of the entire stock of the company Huh 11 So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys starts a massive short squeeze 12 Other's see what's happening and they jump in 13 Now a massive short squeeze starts You have to cover your shorts ASAP But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral You now also have to sell your long positions 14 What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down Which stocks went up Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place Hedge fund grossing / de grossing In other words as stocks like GME go up the highly leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price i e Beta neutral so they’re “safer” To get out of these short positions they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure” triggering a sell off in those stocks A very similar thing actually happened in March with risk parity causing hedge funds to similarly massively de gross and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result even though theoretically COVID 19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis as we saw later on It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de gross causing a widespread stock market crash potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the decade long liquidity leverage fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing In fact this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week according to S3 Partners Furthermore despite seeing the largest de grossing of hedge funds since 2009 gross exposure aka leverage of hedge funds still remains close to record high levels TLDR In case your attention span was too short to read everything above 1 Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases when this happen GME 🚀🌝 2 Much of the stock market’s value is held by over leveraged hedge funds so if GME and other common shorts 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it triggering a financial crisis Now just to be clear buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME That being said with Short Interest barely moving this week this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100 Or in other words I like these stocks EDIT Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted their tweet on Friday and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks fwiw
